The sountrack, gameplay, and replay value are insane! There are only 2 levels, but it is still fun to play over and over and over again! Basically, the objective is to drive around and take customers to the place they want to go. Boring, right? Wrong! Drive as crazy as you like, from crashing into cars to jumping over stuff, or just driving all around crazy! If you don't make it to the customer's destination in time, they'll jump out of the car, which is pretty funny. There are four drivers, and they all have one heck of an attitude. My personal fav is Gus. He's old, but he always plays it cool. Many people think S is the best license you can get, but after that it's awesome and after that it's crazy. There are three modes, arcade, original, and crazy box. Arcade and original are basically the same, except the course on which you play. Crazy Box is a series of minigames. Overall, This Game rules! Unless you've already bought it, buy it now while you can. Despite all the bad reviews For this game, it rocks and you should buy it.

The music is excessively stimulating and the language is harsh for a 10 year old. The age recommendation is to be heeded.

       "You can go for a 3, 5 or 10 minute run.  Your goal is to drive around the city and pick up as many customers as you can.  You can also play in Arcade Mode, where you start out with 50 seconds and get time bonuses for delivering customers to their destination.  A cool thing about the game is that the customers ask to go to real places like the Levi's Store, Pizza Hut, Tower Records and more.  If you don't get the customers to their destination in time, they yell at you and jump out of the car which is pretty funny.\n",
       "However, since there is only one city the game gets boring and repetitive after about a while.  But if you take a little break in between each run it doesn't get boring as quickly.\n",
       "But this game is still really fun and a good purchase.  If you are new to the Gamecube, I would recommened buying games like Super Smash Brothers Melee, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, Metroid Prime and Animal Crossing before getting Crazy Taxi.

The music in this first game is pretty good, well-suited, you'll get tired of it though, and driving without music isn't fun. I start to get sick of it after 10 minutes.

No hidden agendas here - simply drive fast fast fast to earn as many fares as possible.  The faster and crazier the driving - the better.  Slow down and obey the traffic rules means \"Game Over\" in a hurry.\n",
       "The object of the game is very straight forward - pick up and drop off as many people in as little time as possible.  Passengers are color coded for \"easy\" destinations to \"difficult\" destinations.  You can choose from 4 drivers who vary only by personality.  The skill and determination is all up to the game player.  As some other review noted, the controls take a bit of getting used to.  The \"A\" button is not the gas pedal - the \"R\" button is, and the \"L\" button is the brakes.\n",
       "Visually, this is an exceptional game.  The city is nicely detailed, the sound effects are excellent, and the game effects are excellent.\n",
       "What takes some time to learn is how to properly \"drive\" the game inorder to win, or not lose as quickly as you will the first 20 or so times you try the game.  Once you really get into this game, it's a lot of fun and challenging.\n",
       "The negative - the game gets too familiar and comfortable after a while.  There are only 2 cities to choose from (arcade version and the \"original\" game version), so there is challenge in memorizing the extensive layout of both, but after that it's a little repetative.  There are only 4 drivers that vary only in personality, not skill or effects or anything.  You get used to the same revolving set of passengers after a while.\n",
       "Overall, if you're looking for a game that you can devote 30 minutes to at a crack and not be disappointed - this is the one.

There are only 2 different levels and 4 different characters. I got a class S license (the highest ranking) on both levels with all 4 characters in less then 2 hours. Crazy Box mode (Crazy Box mode is Sega's poor attempt at a career mode) is not fun at all and the missions are either too hard or too easy. There is also no car damage making this game seem totally unrealistic. You can run into a wall for ten minutes and your car will stay in top condition. There is no reward to getting a class S license such as additional characters or levels and possibly the biggest problem with this game is there is NO MULTIPLAYER MODE, which would have added some much needed replay value. I've played Simpson's Road Rage and that game isn't much fun either, the graphics made me want to go throw up, however if you absolutely need a game like this, definetly go for Simpson's Road Rage, at least it has a multiplayer option. Crazy Taxi was fun in arcades but it just doesn't work for consoles, maybe the new Crazy Taxi 3 for XBox will at least be slightly fun. The only reason I gave this game 2 stars is because driving around town in a taxi and taking your customers to their alotted destination within a time limit using any means neccessary is a cool concept and the graphics aren't terrible.</td><td>A3H2IG3R802CJY</td><td>Matthew</td><td>null</td><td>I could have made this game</td><td>1024876800</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B000MXIN22</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Excellent</td><td>A249UVIPUIRZZE</td><td>Mark A.

       "The object of the game is to pick up and drop off as many people in as little time as possible, often easier said than done. You can choose between four different driver, which are different in personality, but the same in driving skills. It really makes no difference which one you choose. The controls take a bit of getting used to, and unlike most driving games, the \"A\" button is not the gas pedal. Instead the \"R\" button is the gas, and the \"L\" button is the breaks.\n",
       "Graphically, this is a great game. The city is nicely detailed, and there is a wide variety of people, places, cars, and people at large. In the sound department, the game also has the edge. The car, street, and voices are all nicely done, and the music suits the game perfectly. What it lacks is variety, which means that you will be hearing the Offspring's \"All I Want\" twice in the same game.\n",
       "The flaws in this game come purely from the lack of variety. There is only one city, four drivers, the same passengers, the same four songs played over and over again. There is also no multiplayer mode. The list goes on. But keep in mind that that Crazy Taxi is not meant to be played for hours on end, it is a fun, wild, and wickedly enjoyable game. I would not recommend it to people who favor long, mission-based drivers, for them I would recommend \"Grand Theft Auto 3\". For others who just want a bit of fun, this is your game.

Axel,a slick young driver whose ready for anything! B.D. Joe,a fast party loving hip hop driver! Gena,a hot cool girl who loves the open road. Gus,a old yet ready to go driver with keen looks and attitude! As for the cities you drive through they present huge challenges and many people to pick up. The cities are like Los Angelos and San Franciso complete with beachs,malls,heavy traffic and even cable cars litter the streets making your job harder as you drive through the crowed city! Your passengers that you pick up will want to go anywhere from Kentucky Fried Chicken to the City Bank and the passengers have attitudes of their own too! But aside from the to huge cities and it's residents the point of the game is collect as many fares as you can and get your passengers to their destionation points as soon as possible. Don't worry! No cops will be on your tail so ram into cars and drive wherever you want so you can give your passenger a good time while collecting tips for the craziest stunts you can perform on your way to their dropoff point.

       "Similar to THPS's manuals, Mirra 2 riders can tie their tricks together with heelies and nose wheelies, and flatlanders can even pull endoes and stoppies if they know what they're doing. A wide range of grinds and plants are available, too.\n",
       "In the end, this game will not impress anyone with its mediocre graphics and just decent level designs. What will keep people coming back to this game is its brilliant trick system and the enormous versatility. I still haven't gotten tired of it. If you like bike games, and especially if you bike in real life (like I do :)), you will find this to be the best and most enjoyable bike game available.

This is the first Deer avenger game i've gotten and i like it(well,i also have the handheld version of number 2,shaped like a little shotgun)I plan to pick up the others soon also. If you are lookin to take a break from the more serious games like Max Payne or any other of those (fun)games,this is the game for u.sure there are some tiny flaws,but they are unnoticeable. U can also watch movies,which is a nice feature. But,My favorite part of the game is Bambo's arsenal. You start out with nothing but your wits,instinct, and the Berreta .45. As u build your arsenal and take out more rednecks,u will eventually come across a crossbow and an uzi.u also have a bunch of handy farts like the booster fart which lets u get places faster. Sick of walkin around lookin for those Rednecks?Then use a tracking device of course! Whats that in the distance?A redneck?then put on the scope!(it fits on every gun,even the uzi,Goody Goody)Theres a bunch of cool new rednecks such as Agent x,el nacho,Roxy Etc. Of course,patience is a virtue which u will need a lot of,because this game can get frustrating,but not impossible. You can Hurry things along by using some of Bambo's hilarious new calls (Anyone know Donald Trump,he left his wallet here)or his redneck attracting broccoli farts.u can also hide in bushes,throw lures,and listen to Bambo's comic relief all through the game (but after a while it gets a little old)And another good part is the game lets u go where u want hunt where u want it doesnt really make u go to the next level if u need more practice,or to earn more skill points. The only reason i took off one star is because,it takes a while to find a hunter,and if u get one,and continue hunting and die,u loose the other hunter u bagged. And, occasionally two hunters come after u at the same time making it a little unfair(especcialy if u are only armed w/ a Berreta. 45)All in all,i recommend this game to anyone if u need to take a break from more serious and mature games. I think the teen rating is right on the money considering the language is unsuitable for the little tikes but not so violent as to be a mature rating.

Well their is also a monkey trapped inside the ball, but for gameplay purposes it's irrelevent. The characters are cute and interesting; they actually respond to their environment in a variety of surprising ways. For exempale, when the ball rolls down an incline, the monkey inside runs in the same direction, like a hamster in a wheel. If the speed is to much for the monkey to handle, it trips over itself and starts rolling around in circles! If you roll the ball close to the edge of a platform, you can see the monkey begin to lose balance. These little details add a great deal of personality to a game. If you are not a good gamer than you can play multi player games instead of the adventure. Some of them are monkey race, monkey fight, and monkey target. Additional mini games can be unlocked by earning points in the main game. Those are monkey billiards, monkey bowling, and monkey golf.

The game includes these options  : Main Game- try to get to the finish line wihtout falling off; Party Game- Monkey Race, you and your friends get to go racing down a track using weapons and boosts, alot like mario kart.

And its still fun, if you get tired of games and dismiss them when you beat them; Party Game- Monkey Target, Roll your ball down a giant ramp, and while in midair split the ball open and wear them like wings, you have to try and land on the highest point target, kinda like pilotwings. Mini Game- Monkey Billiards, You play pool with a computer, and its ALOT of fun! Mini Game- Monkey Bowling, You have a swinging aimer, hit that, then choose your power meter, if you need to make an adjustment to where the ball is going, add spin with L and R. Mini Game- Monkey Golf, Well the name says it all, you cn choose the direction and power of your ball, its alot like minature golf. My favorite part is the Music, and how everything is voiced, not text. After all these discs about the size of keys 1-9 on your numpad hold 1.35 gigs!

Many people who have played Monkey Ball shake at the near sight of the later Expert levels, which require extreme balance, speed, coordination, skill, and practice! So don't think this is some little kids game, which can be beaten in a weekend, if you manage to beat it at all. To help improve your skills, and have a killer time with friends, SEGA threw in Monkey Race (Like Mario Kart), Monkey Fight (Punch each other off a large stage), or Monkey Target (flying and then landing on point valued targets). After you earn enough points to buy them you can open up very fun single player mini games, but these mini games had A LOT of time and effort put into them so they are really good quality anf fun. they are: Monkey Billards, Monkey Bowling, and Monkey Golf. Each game adding a fun Monkey inside of the ball twist to it. Those mini games, party games, and over 100+ levels in the main game add up to massive, infinate if you will, replay value.

       "In Super Monkey Ball, you pick one of the three monkey characters to play with.  They are encased in a clear ball (hence the name).  You can pick to play party games, multi-player competitive mode, or single player.  Within the game, there are a series of obstacle courses through which your monkey has to go through without falling off.  You can collect bananas; for each 100 bananas gained, you gain an extra life.  This is especially helpful when reaching harder levels or levels where the maneuvering gets a bit more difficult.  My favorite part of the game is after succeeding reaching a number of levels and when you run out of lives, you get to go through this long track of credits.  The names from the credits fall and you must weave throughout them at risk of dropping your bananas.\n",

I had originally played this game years ago and was not particularly impressed, but in wanting to expand my Nintendo GameCube library recently, I came across this in many 'must-own' titles by game critics. Upon playing, I could see why. The level of re-playability and challenge is so reminiscent of arcade games, and currently still holds up very well. That would be in part to the physics of the game, which demands strong concentration from players. This is very true of the main game mode, which consists of about sixty challenges; but the mini-games adhere to the same characteristics. I wouldn't recommend this game for a novice player or younger children, as this game is definitely difficult. In conclusion, AMAZING game!

In fact I purchased a PS2 almost solely based on the belief that Sony was going to release Wipeout Fusion shortly after the launch (as they claimed). Unfortunately that never occured. Fortunately, however, Extreme G3 was available for the Cube when I went shopping to get games.\n",
       "Let me just say this. Crucial art direction, track layout, and musical direction personnel from Psygnosis went to Acclaim and played crucial parts in the development of Extreme G3. It definitely shows. Extreme G3 conveys the most intense sense of speed and nausea in any racing game ever. You don't know what speed is until you upgrade your engine to the 1000G model and power up the turbo boost in a loop on Oceania or Megalopis.\n",

       "This game is about speed, super speed, sonic boom sound barrier busting speed, and even more speed. The control is ridiculously tight, and the gamecube controller is absolutely *perfect*. It's so good that I basically use the default controller setup scheme.\n",
       "This game is easily one of the best racing games of all time. The weapons system requires intelligence in deployment, i.e., do you use the defensive leech mechanism, or do you drop bombs behind you to slow your opponents down. Do you fire heat seeking rockets at them, or use your shield energy to boost past them. It is a highly intelligent racing game that I appreciate. I find myself these days doing things that in the past I would not have thought of.\n",
       "One of these involves a tactic of actually slowing down so that an opponent can pass, just so that I can activate the leech weapon and siphon off energy if I know that a loop is coming up soon and I'll need all the turbo boost I can store.

It is the fastest racing game ever, and it moves incredibly smooth at 60 fps on the Game Cube. The graphics are superb and the level design is great, it has a beautifully rendered realistic look. Some levels look like the futuristic city in Blade Runner, while others are out in the desert or in the middle of the ocean. The techno soundtrack is also very good and adds to the futuristic feel of the game perfectly. The gameplay is top notch and the controls are right on (the game cube controller is truly excellent, especially for a racing game like this). The high-powered motorcycles zoom through the courses very realistically. There are also a variety of weapons to equip on your motorcycle, which is really cool and adds an extra dimension to the gameplay. Also- The Game Cube version of XG3 features four player mode (which the PS2 version doesn't), and also offers much improved frame rate / graphics over the PS2 version.

Actually, the first 5 or 6 levels or so are pretty fun, but then it rapidly, and painfully, gets difficult. It's a lot like Marble Madness, except for the fun part. A key difference between the way Marble Madness worked and the way this works is that in Marble Madness, if you fell off an edge you lost time, but were placed roughly back where you were before you fell off. In Super Monkey Ball, if you fall off you have to start the level entirely over again. Combine that with levels involving balance beam precision and what you end up with just isn't fun.\n",

       "In Super Monkey Ball, you control a monkey incased in a transparent sphere and try to make your way towards the goal. The controls are a bit different from the classic MM, as you don't directly control the monkey, you tilt the board that you're trying to navigate. And while the single player holds up fairly well, the main draw of this game is the multi-player, more specifically the mini-games. This title includes six mini-games (three of which you have to unlock) and they include Monkey Fight, Monkey Race, Monkey Target, Monkey Billiards, Monkey Bowling, and Monkey Golf, the first three being the most addictive in my opinion.

Super Monkey Ball is Sega's first attempt on the Nintendo GameCube and it quickly became a must have at system launch. What is the premise of Monkey Ball? Well you have this monkey in a ball, add a crazy and dangerous floor. At first glance, you assume you control the monkey, but you do not. You control the tilt of the floor. It makes for some nail biting scenes, and some awful monkey deaths.\n",
       "  Graphically, the monkeys are bright and cartoony, and the Dole bananas (that can be collected for 1-ups) actually look better than the ones that are typically available in the supermarket. The level designs are complex to get the monkey through, but not graphically complex. The game is not revolutionary in terms of graphics. I can see this running on the Dreamcast as well, but the power of the GameCube does shine through in the detail. In levels with water, the water effects are top notch. The monkey in the ball never becomes clouded, all of the lighting effects stay solid, and of course, there is a solid frame rate.\n",
       "  The sound in the game very simple and not at all engaging. It never hinders the game, but it lacks a certain spice to make it interesting or memorable. In Mini-Games the sound is extremely simple, sounding like 4 chords on a synthesizer. There are few short tunes that repeat in the one player modes. Despite the soundtrack, the sound effects are top notch and save the game in this category. The wind as you hurl your monkey over the ocean... the harsh crack as your monkey ball crashes into a wall... It all gets you into the feeling of rolling monkeys around in balls!\n",
       "  The controls in the game are absolutely beautiful. Ultra responsive and smooth. You will never ever blame the controller for your monkey falling off the level. It's also extremely simple. All you need is the control stick for the main game. For the mini games, L and R come into play for games that include tilting the ball. Let's say you get Super Monkey Ball, but you only have one controller. What do you do when friends come over? Well, Super Monkey Ball lets you alternate the one controller for most of the games. Obviously, you can only use this feature during turn-base games. This game has GameCubes best Control and Control Set-Up so far.\n",
       "  The main game in Super Monkey Ball is divided into three difficulties: Beginner, Advanced, and Expert. Ninety boards await you in this mode; 10 in Beginner, 30 in Expert, and 50 in Expert. If that wasn't enough, there are bonus levels after you complete all of the floors in the difficulty level. Of course, you can't use a continue. Just you try to get bonus stages in Expert, we dare you! When you play single player, you acquire points to use to unlock Mini-Games.\n",
       "  Initially available are the three Party Games available to play: Monkey Race, Monkey Fight, and Monkey Target. Monkey Race lets up to four players race on six different tracks. The concept sounds pretty simple, but to mix it up a bit, players can collect special items, including bombs and ball morphs (ie, turn the sphere into a cube). In Monkey Fight each monkey has a large boxing glove attached to his ball via a spring. The monkeys then roll around for a minute at a time, trying to punch their opponents off of the platform. Again, power-ups make it all the more fun and some of the power-ups here are just plain wacky! In Monkey Target monkeys roll down a long ramp and fly into the air. Once airborne, pressing the A button will open the ball to form a pair of wings. The monkey can then be steered toward the targets floating in the water, and dropped onto them by hitting A again. Its not as simple as it sounds, add in the wind factor, power-ups and the Wheel Of Death (!), and you got yourself a great party game. All three of the party games are an absolute riot to play, especially Monkey Target; not only are they well done, but for the record, what is funnier than seeing a monkey rolling in a ball at 500mph.\n",
       "  As if those weren't enough, players can unlock three additional Mini-Games by accumulating Play Points in the main levels. These three games include Monkey Billiards, Monkey Golf, and Monkey Bowling. Again, these games are pretty much exactly what they sound like; Billiards presents the monkeys in a classic billiard setting, and Golf puts them through 18 holes of miniature golf. Monkey Bowling is hands down, the best of the Mini-Games. It may take you a little while to get used to the idea behind controlling the monkey, but it makes bowling on a screen fun. The idea is to tilt and spin the monkey as much as you can to get it into the center of the pins. It becomes a science as you lightly squeeze L and R to put the correct spin on the monkey.

Of course, the one player mode can be adjusted for two to four players. You can also win bonus points in one player to unlock more mini-games. You can unlock monkey bowling, monkey golf, and monkey billiards. The graphics are excellent and you can have fun playing this over again.

Part of the reason it gets boring is the difficulty. I've beaten it in begginer mode, but I've only gotten to the 11th stage on advanced and the 5th on expert. And if you're good enough to beat begginer, advanced, and expert mode completely, you'll unlock master mode, which, as hard as expert is, must be impossible. The mini-games are a blast,which is the only reason this game didn't get 2 stars. You have to unlock three, and you start out with three. My personel favorite is Monkey Fight. You're one of Four monkeys(their names are Aiai, Meme, Gongon, and Baby, but it doesn't matter which one you use) and They all have huge Sockom Bopper Type Things to punch with, and you can have really springey boppers, or big ones, but you have to break open the box before anybody else does, or you don't get it. Monkey Golf and Monkey Billards I haven't unlocked yet, so I don't know much about them. Monkey Target I don't understand very well. I know how to play it, but I can never reach the target before I fall into the water. It's also hard because there might be spiked balls or other dangerous hazards you must dodge while struggling to stay in the air. Now onto Monkey race. This is just all-out pure fun. Bacsically you race around the course against three other monkeys. Nothing much more to say about it. Now onto the only mini-game I've unlocked, Monkey Bowling. Very Fun. You control where you go, how far, and how hard. That's about it. Now you're probally saying \"This guy says alot of good things about the mini games why didn't he give it four, or even five stars?\" The answer is, it'll never be worthy of five, and I didn't give 4 because it's not the mini games that count, it's the main cocept, which as I said earliar isn't that good. Wher're almost finished, I just have to give my final comments. Note to parents: worried about the increasing violence in video games? Want a totally non-violent and kid-friendly first game for your kid? Get this. The only violence is Monkey Fight, which isn't very violent at all. And besides, the camera is way high up, so you can't see what's goingon that well. Anyway parents, don't avoid it! In conclusin, You should rent it first, and if you like it, buy it. I haven't played 2, but I hope it will be better. Nintendo is still the best system made. Well, there you go, Android 21 signing off.  PS.

My only complaint was (in the stores) they have been offering the same colors for years. I wanted something in the taupe zone, but could never find. Then recently, I went into Kohl's (since I never shop there anymore) to see what they had that might fill that need. Surprised to find W2W in bark - perhaps not taupe but close enough. Unfortunately they were not \"on sale\" and priced at least $15 more than I thought I should spend. I went home and looked online at Sears and found W2W in bark for less than $29 (after redeeming a coupon and SYW points). W/O the discounts they were $35, still not a bad price IMO. The new ones came from Sears yesterday and they seem to be the same fabric and quality I have come to expect.  I don't see why the ones sold here would be any different in quality than the ones I have bought over the years at either JCP or Sears, but other people have different expectations and opinions.

The basic concept has no plot and it bears resemblance to the pinball madness games that older gamers might remember from the past.  For those who are unfamiliar with older games of this type, the idea is to tilt the stage with the joystick and maneuver a monkey in a ball (hence the name) and reach the goal.  The idea seems very simple at first, and it is, however when you try the 'expert' levels, you will realize just how hard this game is.  The game is easy to pick up and hard to put down...you will not finish it quickly.\n",
       "One of the major pluses of Super Monkey Ball is the multiplayer mode.  Three starting games are present, in which you have the ability to 'monkey fight' which is where you try to push another monkey off of the stage using a punching glove and extras in an arena, very similar to 'Bumper Ball' in the Mario Party games.  Also, there is Monkey Target in which you try to land a monkey ball on stages to receive points.  Complimented finally by Monkey race, in which a mariokart-ish engine is used, with only three tracks.  Also, the bonuses in the game which are earned by doing well in the main game are fun as well.  Monkey Billiards (Pool), Monkey Bowling, and Monkey Golf (Putt-Putt).  Overall, the multiplayer is a very enjoyable experience.\n",
       "Music is good, and it doesn't inhibit the gameplay...Graphics are decent, and don't take advantage of the gamecube's abilities, but they aren't going to make you turn your head the other way or break any mirrors.

This game is flat out fun, no other word to describe it. I read some inaccuracies in the official review and in some other reviews on here. You don't tilt the floor in this game, you are actually in control of the monkey in the transparent ball and you move them around in the ball to get through the board. Sometimes the board tilts and gives the illusion that you are controlling the board as opposed to the monkey but that's not the case. You have a time limit to get to the goal without falling off of the board. There are four unique monkeys to choose from, and more than one person can use the same character, they'll just be a different color. Along the way, you can collect bananas and like Mario or Donkey Kong games, when you collect 100, you get a 1up.\n",
       "Anyway, if you play one player mode, you must have patience. There are three difficulty levels: Beginner, Advanced, and Expert. Each has 10, 30, and 50 levels, respectively. Beginner is pretty easy, I finished all 10 levels without losing any monkeys. Getting to board 30 on Advanced is a trip and I still haven't been able to pass it, but half of the fun was getting there. Expert is really hard and of the 50 levels, I've probably seen 10. When you play in one player mode, you earn Play Points. Play Points allow you to unlock the Mini Games (Monkey Billiards, Monkey Bowling, and Monkey Golf). It kind of reminds me of Mario Party in that respect. So far, I've unlocked Bowling and Billiards, both of which are fun.\n",
       "The cool thing about this game is that every mode can be played in multiplayer. (Just remember, you can only earn Play Points in one player mode.) Whether you want four people to play the regular floor-to-floor game, or Monkey Fight (knock your opponent off the platform with a boxing glove, a little like a minigame in Mario Party), or Monkey Race (a lot like Mario Kart with the items), or the Target game (a lot like P-Wings, I love this mode, a whole lot of fun). In addition, all of the minigames can be played by up to four people. Bowling is very straight forward, pick the angle, then the power, then the spin you want to put on the ball. Billiards is 9-ball. Haven't seen Golf yet.\n",
       "Half of the fun is watching. My friends and I, a 24, 25, 26 and 29 year-old were playing this for a couple of hours, and we all go for different types of games. The monkeys are so entertaining that you find yourself laughing at them constantly. Trying not to fall off in the Normal Mode will ruin your nerves. It keeps you on the edge of your seat when you're watching someone manuever through a tough spot. It's one of those games that makes it fun to be a spectator.\n",

       "I'm a father of three young children (2,5,9) and an avid PC Gamer. I decided to initiate my family to video games with the purchase of a Gamecube this Christmas. I chose the Gamecube because I believe that it will come with more \"family friendly\" games. My philosophy is that a video game system should be used to bring people together for some recreation. After all, it is typically located in the Family Room. So I bought the system and 4 controllers. The only game I purchased was Monkey Ball.\n",
       "Don't get me wrong, it's a decent game, but I don't believe it contains the value for what you pay. Here are the major things that bother me about it.\n",
       "1. 1/3 of the program is automatically locked up until you gain enough points in normal mode to unlock it (the Mini games). Beginner level in normal mode gets hard fast, we have yet to earn a point so I have no idea how long it will take to gain access to the rest of the product. I think that this is simply bad design. I prefer to have immediate access to these games especially since they are completely unrelated to the activities in Normal mode. I could understand it if these were special levels or extras that related to Normal mode, but they aren't. This design is only appropriate for those who want their children to play video games all day long.\n",
       "2. For a family game, it's creepy to see your cute little monkey in the ball fall off the edge of a platform suspended miles in the air. As your entrapped monkey falls or teeters on the edge of the platform, he/she yells and waves his/her arms. If you're not afraid of heights, this game will make you afraid of them. Nintendo went to great lengths to boost the realism and all the games occur miles in the sky and trust me, you won't want to be the cause of the demise of these cute little creatures. I guess, this is a little alternative psychology to try harder.\n",
       "3. We spend all our time in the Mini games, Monkey race and Monkey fight. These are what everyone talks about. Monkey race is similar to Mario Kart but again, I was disappointed by the terrible selection of courses to choose from. If this is a major reason to buy the game, save your money until Mario Kart comes out. There just isn't enough variety to keep you interested for long.\n",

For those of you who don't know about this game, it basically involves moving a floor to make a monkey in a clear, plastic ball move to a goal. The three levels of play for the single-player main game are Beginner, Advanced, and Expert. Beginner and Advanced are both fairly easy, but when you get to the later levels in Expert, you had better be willing to devote a few hours to beating them. If navigating a 3D puzzle isn't your thing, you can choose to play any one of six mini or party games, including billiards, mini-golf, bowling, fight, race, or target. The first three games are pretty straight-forward, and can be played with up to two people. The latter three are capable of being played with up to four people. While playing fight, you command a monkey with a boxing glove attached to the ball, and you try to knock other monkeys with boxing gloves off a platform. Race needs no explanation, and target makes you launch your monkey off a ramp and then try to glide over the ocean to targets. The problem with Super Monkey Ball is that the game hardly ever has the correct difficulty level, almost always being either too hard or too easy. So far most of my time has been spent playing the mini-games. If you're a big party or puzzle gamer, then Super Monkey Ball is for you. If not, I would recommend a rental first, as Super Monkey Ball is a very quirky game with a certain taste needed to enjoy it.</td><td>A2FQWENHE6YOLY</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>{\"Platform:\":\" GameCube\"}</td><td>A Fun Filler In-between Other Games</td><td>1010448000</td><td>false</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>B000MXLYVY</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>excellent design and sewing.

Looks can be very deceiving.  I was completly uninterested in ever playing this game.  However, I went to the video store to rent a game for my new Gamecube I just got for Christmas and of course nearly everything was already out, except for this game.  IT'S SO MUCH FUN! This game is endless!  It's like having 7 or 8 different games all in one.  The main game, like everyone says, is exactly like Marball Madness from the old NES.  The mazes are hard and challenging.  The beginner level has about 8 or so levels that are good learning courses.  Then 30 on the advanced stages, and 50 on the expert.  There is another hidden Master mode (rumored to have 80).  I can only get past level 20 on the Advanced and level 7 on the Expert, just to show how much replay value this game does have.  To add to this, there's a multiplayer  game in this too.  Either take turns finishing the levels, or pick five levels you like and compete with 1 or 3 of your friends to see who gets to the finish first.  To add to all of that, there's Monkey Bowling (which we tend to spend most of our time playing), monkey billards, Monkey golf (it's like miniture golf....really hard, but fun), Monkey target (just started playing it, seems really hard but alot of fun as well, and last but not least Monkey race.  Monkey race is exactly like Mario Kart, except the fact that they're monkeys.....in a ball.  It has about 6 or 7 racing levels which get more and more challenging.  You pick up objects to throw...etc,etc.  It's alot of fun.  THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST WELL-ROUNDED GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED.  I don't like too many one-player games, because I get bored of them after a while.  And once it's beaten, it's really never played again.  So I try to stick with the multi-player games like (my favorite...and it seems everyone elses) Super Smash Bros. Melee and now Monkey Ball.  My wife and my friends had a great time playing this.  We couldn't stop playing it.  It's very competitive and heck of a lot of fun.  There are only two downsides to this game.\n",
       "1) The side games ARE smaller versions of something like Mario Kart, Bowling, etc. and you really do wish there were more levels and stages. (that doesn't mean that they get boring or are not fun.  It just like everything that's good...you just want more.  For Smash Bros....even though there's 13 more characters then the last game, I still wish there were more)\n",
       "2) There's only 4 monkey's to choose from.  I wish there were more.  The antics get a little repetitive and annoying (especially Baby).  Even though they're all the same, move at the same speed, etc. (baby's easier to control on the mazes though...since it's so small and crawls close to the ground).\n",
       "Renters note:  The mini games (Bowling, Billards, Golf) are all locked.  You have to play a regular one-player game to unlock it.  It won't work if you play with 2 or more people.  You receive \"play points\" for every level you complete.  You need 2500 for each mini game.  For example on the beginner's course, if you play all 8 levels and beat them without continuing you get about 700 or so play points.  Every time you lose all your men it stops the play point counter and tells you how much you have, and how much you need until you unlock it.  Sounds lame, but it was really fun tring to unlock them.  We just kept passing the controller around the room letting everyone do a level.\n",
       "SUM-UP:  Based on a quick glance, this game looks lame and completely unappealing.  It's not.  I had no desire to ever play it and I now love it.  So if you're interested even a litte, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Rent it if anything.  The first time you play, get a bunch a friends together.  That's what makes it so much fun.  It's one of the best multi-palyer games I've played. It's extremely well-rounded and promises that there is something for everyone....except if you really have a strong distaste for monkeys, and monkey's in balls for that matter.

This controller is one of the best ever made. No doubt about it. Nintendo's previous controller, from the Nintendo 64, was good, but not great. It was a very different type of design. The GameCube controller is a million times better than that controller. It's really hard to believe. The very first time I held this controller in my hands, I knew it was a winner.\n",
       "  Many people say this controller was made for people with small hands. I disagree with that. I have small hands myself, but I have a few friends who have huge hands, and they have no problems with it. The left and right triggers are in the perfect position for both of your index fingers. All the buttons on the right side of the controller are easily accessible with your right thumb. They button layout is nearly perfect; with an enlarged \"A\" button for games with repetitive pressing of a single button. The analog stick can be easily accessed with your left thumb, and it rotates smoothly every time. The C-stick has replaced the C buttons from the previous N64 controller, and it allows for much more precise control.\n",
       "  The only problems I could possibly think of with this controller are that the control pad is a bit small, but it is very rarely used, so that really isn't too big of a problem and the second thing I could think of was that the length of the controller cable is a bit short, but that can be easily fixed with extension cables. And now that the WaveBird is out, you can enjoy the wonderful GameCube controller without all the trouble of cables!\n",
       "  I've had this controller for nearly eight months now, and it is still extremely dependable. All the buttons are still firm, and the control stick is still nice and tight. Nintendo hardly needs to issue any kind of a warrantee with this controller; there is hardly any chance of anything bad happening to it.  You would have to drop something heavy on it, or pour something on it.  I've dropped my controller numerous times, and nothing has happened to it yet.  It is still in nearly brand new factory specifications. I am truly amazed.\n",
       "  Overall, this controller is better than any of its counterparts. It deserves the \"best controller\" award in my book. Nintendo has come up with another masterpiece.\n",

The button layout may seem slightly untraditional, but this is a good thing, believe me. Nintendo realized that there's almost always one main button in games, so they made the A button larger. The B, X and Y buttons are laid out strategically around the A button, providing quick and easy access. They also have slightly different shapes, which makes them easily distinguishable from each other (without having to look). The top two shoulder buttons (L & R buttons) are analog, so the harder you press the more they react, which proves very useful in many games. Also, the shape of the L & R buttons are terrific, they are curved inward to fit your fingers perfectly. The Z button is located in front of the R button. It makes sense that they didn't put a counterpart on the left side- since you're using the analog stick or d-pad it really would be difficult to use another shoulder button effectively on the left side. Although it probably wouldn't have hurt to include it, but there are more than enough buttons anyways.\n",
       "The main complaint I have heard about the GameCube controller is the smaller D-pad. Personally, I barely noticed that it was smaller and find absolutely no difference or extra challenge in using it. In fact I think I can actually complete moves faster in Tony Hawk 3 because it's slightly smaller, so there! The analog control stick is very strong and will stay precise for many years, which is much better than the N64 analog stick (which always got very loose and became unusable) Also, the C-stick will be used mainly as a camera button or simply another analog controller when necessary, it hasn't been utilized much yet. The analog joystick and C joystick both have rubber tops that provide excellent grip. There's also the obligatory built-in rumble feature (an element that Nintendo brought to controllers first with the N64).\n",
       "There is absolutely no question in my mind that this controller is much better than either the PS2 or Xbox controller (I've used them all enough to judge). Sony's controller isn't bad, but it definitely doesn't feel nearly as nice and takes longer to get accustomed to (PS2 owners may think their controller is the best, but they are just more used to it). And Microsoft's controller is awful in my opinion; it's like an inflated dreamcast controller, maybe even worse than that. I believe that the GameCube controller is really the most intuitive and most comfortable design ever! When I first saw it I thought it would be good, when I actually held it I knew it could be great, and when I finally played games with it I realized that it's the best controller ever created!

You never have to look down at the controller to see what button you're pressing like on some (\"Am I pressing the X or the O?\"), because you can always tell which is which by touch alone.

First off, there are only four normal buttons to this controller, with one start button, no select button! Then there are huge L + R buttons, why are they so huge? Because the L + R buttons constantly break with the N64 and Super Nintendo controllers, so Nintendo redesigned the L + R buttons and made them spring loaded and big to take the pressure of little kids jamming the buttons with their fingers. Next there are two analog sticks, one on the top left and one on the bottom right for shooting games like the 007 games and A Perfect Dark games. For accurate game control there is an old fashioned directional pad at the bottom left. Also, you no longer have to put memory cards into the controller, because of the new Gamecube design (you put the cards into the Gamecube) and finally there is a rumble pack built into the controller, which never needs batteries due to the new technology.

Hidden under the cute graphics and simple control scheme is one of the most addictive games I've ever played.  The point of the main game is to roll a ball (with a monkey inside it!) around on a platform (usually weirdly-shaped and full of traps), avoid falling off the platform and try to guide it safely through a \"goal\" gate.  The direction/movement of the ball is controlled INDIRECTLY by tilting the platform.  The control is very simple and most people can pick it up easily: only the analog control stick is used, YES, you can play this game with just your left thumb.  And since it's analog, the angle at which the platform is tilted is directly related to how hard you push that analog stick.\n",

While Beginner mode is faily straight forward, the difficulty grows in exponential speed in Advanced and Expert.

       "and after playing main game enough you can unlock golf, pool, and bowling, which are fun but are a lot better to play with friends. a good way to unlock the games (you need 2500 points each) is to play a round of advanced, get as far as you can, hopefully get around 1500 points, then play beginner, beat the levels as fast as you can (faster=more points) and without dying then beat the bonus levels, and you get 600+ points, if you're even just decent at the game, you can do that in well under 5 minutes, though don't play it more than twice in a row, leave it and go off or play another game and come back to get more points later because playing the same levels over too much too soon (for the main game) drains the fun\n",

I BEAT THE GAME IN 6 minutes and 7 seconds!  its not fun.  the graphics are good but the music is annoying and the game is not fun.  it may be a party game but it is only for kids under 8 i think.  and the toys r us that i baught it from won't even allow me 2 exchange it for THPS3.  so now i'm stuck with this game and my parents are mad at me and will never lend me money AGAIN!!!</td><td>A5F1S2IUT6Z6H</td><td>alex metz</td><td>{\"Platform:\":\" GameCube\"}</td><td>LISTEN TO ME!

       "\n",
       "Color:  The box stores only carry a few color options, so Amazon was the best option for variety for me.  The only color that was a bit different than expected was the \"Graphite\" color.  I was expecting to get a dark gray which turned out to be dark gray/blue.  The color has held up well to over a dozen dry cleans and even additional washes (I dry clean my newer pairs and wash my older).\n",
       "\n",
       "Zipper / Button /  Belt Loops:  No snags yet with any of my pant zippers.  They are \"Ideal\" metal zippers.  The waist button is plastic, matches the rear pocket button and is otherwise not noteworthy.  The belt loops are narrow however are stitched quite well, I wear a wide belt with these and have never had an issue or one break on me.\n",
       "\n",
       "Center Pleat:  A word of caution in this regard.  It maybe my dry cleaners but they seem to like to crease them at a slightly different location.  I'm not sure if this is because they naturally want to pleat differently or if it's because of careless dry cleaners.  Either way, it's happened to at least 2 pairs of mine already which creates a double pleat look...ie.  they're no longer my \"good\" pairs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Durability:  The other reviews mention the tendency of the hems to fray in a short amount of time.  Well, yes they do fray, however the time in which they do in my opinion is acceptable for a $35.00 pair of pants.  When dry cleaned only, I get about 12 cleans out of them before the hems begin to wear.  So, if rotated with other pants, this can be about a years worth.  Machine washing is a different story, they begin fraying after the 3rd or 4th wash and of course this leads to fading prematurely as well.  For me and my usage, I get about a year of business casual use and about another year of casual use out of them.\n",

       "Now, the Gamecube I think is a great Console to have. There are games on it you can't get anywhere else. Some of them are duds but lots of them are wonderful games. For me I just gotta have them. They are not only nostalgic but they are freaking fun! And great to play with friends. I have played games like Mario Kart Double Dash and Super Smash Bros. with my friends for hours trying to settle feuds and bets. Another thing is that this console, is almost INDESTRUCTIBLE. My first ever Gamecube was thrown on the pavement outside by my brother. Not once, over and over. It didn't look very pretty with all the scratches and cracks, but the thing TURNED ON! Go try that with a PS3 or Xbox. (No don't do that, totally kidding) Months before I put the Gamecube in an overnight bag to a friends. I put it in the same bag as my shampoo and conditioner. Guess what happened. Well,  Shampoo was all up in this thing, the controller, games, wires it was everywhere. I cleaned it as best I could, me and my dad had Q-tips taking everything apart cleaning it all. It still worked. This thing can go through a lot of crap which is amazing because it is meant for kids, but also enjoyed by adults!  The video games have so much variety there are scary violent games, to nice sweet harmless games and everything in between. Maybe Mario isn't the king for you like he is for me, but you cannot tell me you've never enjoyed playing one of his games. If you have never played a Mario game,  start with Super Mario 64. You won't be disappointed. Even though the Gamecube is not the latest technology, I'd still recommend buying one to ANYONE. The graphics aren't fully there like today. But some of the best video games ever made don't look anything like real life or 3D.

It is one of the best baseball games but baseball games are not that exciting to begin with.</td><td>A3OBRBYMVBFX3Z</td><td>Daniel E Halligan</td><td>null</td><td>Baseball Lovers' Game</td><td>1009670400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B000MXQ2CU</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Pants look nice on me.

This is the system that even Nintendo geeks don't even own. Why because of the Wii. The Wii is backwards compatible with the Gamecube. So you can play all your Gamecube games on the Wii. So I am going to tell you why a Gamecube is still worth owning!\n",
       "\n",
       "1. The controller the beautiful beautiful controller! The thing fits perfectly in your hand! Nintendo knew how good the controller was because there are Wii games that use that controller. (With the new Smash Bros Wii U even). The buttons are perfectly sized. You are going to use the A button the most. So they made it bigger.  The L&R buttons are grooved with your fingers. The X&Y controllers are perfectly placed as well. With a Analogue and digital joystick perfectly placed on both sides of the controller. With a D-pad. Just cause. The only problem with this controller is that there is no select button.\n",

But you can play GBA, and Gameboy games on the Gamecube like a super Gameboy. To my knowledge this is the only way to do that. Which is pretty neat beacuse there are many fine GBA games that translate well to the big screen. Also If you do not own a NES the GBA classic series may be for you!\n",

I'm not kidding this system and a few friends = endless fun.\n",

(I was the \"cool\" kid with a Dreamcast) The Gamecube was the last pre internet console. Remember the Internet when the Gamecube was new? Well I don't! If somebody were to say the word Smosh, Pewdie Pie, or Jontron you would be downright confused. The only way you could tell if a game was good is if your friend had it. So that meant calling your friend (pre texting era) or riding your bike over to there house to see for yourself. I used to put the system on the floor because it was my favorite at the time. I used to turn it on and off with my toe. I had to ask my parents to hook it up! My dog would fall asleep on it. So many memories lie within that console.\n",

In what way is the X-box a box anyway? Or a PlayStation a station that you play in? It also used really tiny discs. Which are cool I guess.\n",

The basic gameplay is something of an elevated arcade shooter.

You'll have an infrared heads-up display and basic command over your wingmen, as well as an extra payload of bombs or torpedoes to get the job done.

It controls like a dream and the war is great.  THe battle from the movies are so cool and the way TIE fighters now explode is great pyrotechnics.  SOunds are great and just everything is sensational.  This game is one of the greatest games ever made!  Wingmen commands are also super cool.  Other games don't really have wingmen.  This adds a slight realism.  Playing as the ace-pilot Wedge Antilles is also very cool.  My cons are only in the TIEi fighters,  They are too sutpid.  When I first played battle of ENDOR, I six TIE fighters crashed into me.  I survived but that was just crap.  Also the wingman don't do much except maybe knock out ten or fifteen TIE fighter before the level ends.  They fly awkwardly and fire at enemies too slowly.  The other Rebel pilots that are not your wingman don't do anything expcet take up space.  They should be just like your wingman and actually do something.  Also, again, you fight hundreds of TIE ifhgtrs and other ships alone.  You do most of the work and destroy lik hundreeds of enemies.  Not too realistic on that matter.

       "I didn't find the tutorial mission to be much help (though you do get to bulls eye womp rats); it was more exploration than instruction. You're probably better off just jumping into the first mission that pits you, Luke Skywalker, piloting your trusty X-Wing as Red five, against the original Death star.\n",
       "It looks right out of the movie and really sets the mood for the game. The first two parts of this first mission are basically tutorial as you attack cannon towers and hapless tie fighters that rarely shoot back or do much in the way of evading. You're able to give your wingmen commands to do a number of things and they're pretty effective at carrying out orders. The only difficulty in the mission comes when Darth Vader appears with a guard of Tie Interceptors, wounds Wedge, and then blows Biggs away(*sniffle*). You must, as Obi-Wan's spirit guides,'..Use the force, Luke' to finish off the Death Star. You all know the rest.\n",
       "Each mission gives you three lives to complete the three-part missions. After each successfully completed mission, statistics are compiled and medals are awarded (or not awarded) according to your proficiency. Each medal is worth points and can be used to unlock alternate fighters and missions. Each mission also has upgrades hidden somewhere in the map which can be used to upgrade ships' components. It is worth noting that the missions jump rather radically in difficulty so that by the third mission, you're up against a Star Destroyer and cursing blasted Wedge for not backing you up. If you could clone Porkins, I'm sure he'd die in every mission.\n",
       "The mission difficulty is probably the most frustrating aspect of the game, but also the most rewarding. One minute you'll be cursing the game and its makers and trying to restrain yourself from smashing the controller and then suddenly realize some new tactical strategy that lets you finish the mission. I will say that the final mission is simply too difficult--realistic, but too difficult. I beat it after much pain and cursing.\n",
       "The technical aspects of the game are very well done. The controls are responsive and every craft feels very different to pilot. There are also several views (inside cockpit, just behind fighter, far back of fighter, and bombing view for those fighters that are capable) and each viewpoint has advantages and disadvantages. The graphics are some of best to be seen on the Cube to date--up there with Resident Evil and the like. The missions that recreate battles from the movies look exactly like their movie counterparts. I also didn't encounter any glitches or bugs while playing this game.\n",
       "The audio is terrific and appropriate for a Star Wars game. The staple soundtrack and sound effects are right out of the movies.

       "The game's easy to pick up and a lot of fun.  The missions aren't incredibly difficult to get through, though earning gold medals on all of them is next to impossible, at least before you've found all the hidden powerups and unlocked some of the extra ships.  Some of the requirements are a little *too* stringent, if you ask me -- why include the targeting computer, and a powerup that lets you keep it on all the time, if you're *not* supposed to use it?  Also, to kill enough enemies to earn a gold medal on most missions, you have to get rid of your wingmen, which removes the whole appeal of *having* wingmen in the first place.  There are also levels where it's too easy to lose (or miss a medal) because you made a simple mistake.  When a mission takes 10-15 minutes to complete, that gets real annoying real fast.\n",
       "In any case, I can't say this is a *bad* game; it just didn't jump out at me as one of my favorites.  The lack of a multiplayer mode (being remedied in its upcoming sequel, which is supposed to have cooperative multiplayer) might be part of it.  It could also benefit from more of an overarching storyline (like in the X-Wing games on the PC) -- each mission feels disconnected from the others.  Part of the problem is also that I had the first Rogue Squadron on the N64, and this feels like mostly the same game with better graphics.  I'm holding out hope that Rogue Squadron III will improve on all these areas.\n",

       "Speaking of games, the NGC is a force to be reckoned with. It's really not that complicated. Xbox is out of the race before it even starts. Besides Halo & Fable, anything on an Xbox you can get anywhere else. Now comes the PS2. Ok, PS2 has by FAR the most games, and a crazy amount of them are good, but a crazy amount of games are also bad. THEN, you can't get Nintendo exclusives at all on a PS2 at all, and that's saying a lot, because unlike PS2 & Xbox, the NGC first party releases alone are are enough to power a system lol, & that's no exaggeration. Most good third party games on the PS2 can be found on the NGC. The others either don't matter cuz they're crap, or the NGC makes up for it, cuz it has ALOT of good games the PS2 doesn't have either. Incredible exclusives like Mario games, StarFox, Kirby, Pikmin, Pokemon, Donkey Kong, F-Zero, Zelda, Super Smash Bros, Fire Emblem, Metroid Prime, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles & Tales Of Symphonia are only a few in a very long line of epic games you can get only on the NGC & they're all great. Most are nominees for game of the year or winner of that award. NGC has less games than the PS2, but a higher percentage of it's games are good games.\n",

It just does what it's suppose to be, something to play video games on, and does it extremely well.

But watch out Vader's on your ass, he even says \"The Force is strong with this one\". And Obi-Wan is with you \"Use the Force Luke\". As you get closer to the port some one comes over the radio saying \"Luke, you switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong?\", \"Nothing I'm all right\". That mission alone makes the game worth buying, hell, it makes the GameCube worth buying. Other missions include The Battle of Hoth, The Battle of Endor, and even the Escape From the Death Star (using the Falcon's turrets to fend off incoming TIE's). You can unlock ships like the Slave 1, the B-Wing, The X-1 Advance (Vader's TIE Fighter) and even the Naboo N-1 star fighter! All the missions and ships have a little description into their history. For example: \"An illegally modified, Corilean Engineered YT-1300 transport, The Millenium Falcon, is one of the more formidable star ships in the galaxy. Owned and piloted by Han Solo and his Wookie partner Chewbacca...\" I could go on and on. There is a chase camera view, but that sucks compared to the cockpit view.

Sadly, it was a poor choice. I own the original Rogue Squadron and I really enjoy the game, so I figured this would be a great first rental. Right from the start though, I was disappointed.\n",
       "The game starts with corny dancing Stormtroopers to some old time music holding up yellow squares to form the Lucas logo or something. Whaa? That kinda breaks the mood... but forgivable. Then I got to the menu screen... scenes from the movies played randomly in the background serving no apparent purpose, except maybe to give the developers less original work to do.\n",
       "When I finally got in game, being new to the Gamecube, I hit the training mission. I figured I'd learn about all the cool abilities of the various crafts and how to best fight the Empire. Instead, I'm \"treated\" to a empty field with random training icons floating. Most are completely useless, such as \"press A to fire... Good Job!!\" A few are truly retarted... \"You found a Jabba's Palace... GOOD JOB!!\". If I had that computer tell me 'good job' just one more time... I would have thrown my controller down right then and there. So, annoyed, I quit and headed for the first mission...\n",
       "Without any good explanation or reason, I'm suddenly fighting above the Death Star. Lasers are shooting everywhere, tie's are flying in every possible direction, and my wingmen are screaming at me for leadership. I liked it. I quickly pull up the targeting computer and take down a few ties. Then I order my wingmen to do the same, and set upon the mission's goals. It was a great mission, but random.\n",
       "Next mission, I'm in an asteroid field. How on earth did I get here? No... never mind... it looks gorgeous, who cares. I'm blasting stuff, having a unconvinced but good time. Sadly, this doesn't last until mission 3. By mission 3 I'm bored, the gorgeous graphics die down to just standard locations, and the missions are very tedious. By the later levels, it was so easy to mess up a small detail and have to start over I said forget it, no more.\n",
       "This game starts off with a major blast (if you avoid the training) and dies quickly from there. It doesn't get better, it just keeps going instead.

       "Well right off the bat, the console is smaller and takes up less room, and instead of a Cartridge the GameCube uses a disc.

Also, there are two memory card slots and four controller slots all built in to the console.\n",

       "Moving on to controllers, they mastered two things, the joystick and the rumble pack. The joystick for the Nintendo 64 wear out easily and they're rough on the hands, (they gave me blisters) now they're much easier to use and they don't wear out as easily. Also, instead of a bulky rumble pack to go on to the controller, now it's built into it making it lighter. I loved the Nintendo 64 controller for its unique design and I was a little disappointed that the GameCube's design is more like a regular controller but over all they did a good job.\n",
       "\n",
       "Nintendo 64's memory could be great than terrible. Some games didn't need memory cards because they had built in memory, and then sometimes one game could take up a whole memory card. The GameCube made this simple. There are three memory cards sizes, 59 blocks, 251 blocks and 1019 blocks. Each game takes up a certain amount of blocks, for example, Super Mario Sunshine only takes up 9 blocks and that's a pretty big game. So you get a lot of room on one memory card which means you will be spending a lot less money on memory cards.\n",
       "\n",
       "Most importantly the games, there are 640 games on the GameCube so there are plenty to choose from and most of them are family friendly games.

From the original vector-based Star Wars Arcade game on, there's just something about being able to tap into an universe that you're already familiar with. Unfortunately, like many licensed titles, these have been hit and miss over the years, though the hits have been many on Nintendo consoles. Rogue Leader is no exception, setting a new mark for excellence in a Star Wars game. While fans of the more technical TIE and X-Wing shooters on the PC might find this a step down as far as gameplay is concerned, most Star Wars fans will come to the agreement that no game has captured Star Wars so well visually. No other early GameCube game comes close to the visual splendor to be found, and very few play as well to boot.\n",
       "Graphics: 10.0  One word sums up Rogue Leader's graphical prowess: AMAZING! No game I've seen on any platform has caught me more by surprise than the graphical beast that is the Rogue Leader engine. While I suppose that I shouldn't be all that surprised, Factor 5 did some great work on the Nintendo 64 after all (Rogue Squadron & Indiana Jones & the Infernal Machine in particular), I suppose that I just wasn't prepared for the leap they were able to take from the Nintendo 64. Not only are the ship models extremely accurate to their motion picture counterparts (I've read specs that state that they're actually MORE detailed than the 3D models used in the Special Editions), but the textures are top-notch. The level of detail is also amazing. Not only have the environments from the films been effectively recreated (one might argue that some even look better), but the little things, such as stormtroopers running around and turbolasers firing in the distance as far as the eye can see, convince you at times that you are actually there. Via the GameCube, Factor 5 has basically accomplished in real time what fans have been wanting for years...a chance to PLAY the movie. Sure, I might be exaggerating just a bit, but I will not be guilty of underrating Rogue Leaders visuals; they are that good. Besides, as a long-time fan of the classic Trilogy (hey, I've played the Atari computer version of Star Wars Arcade!), you'll forgive me for that. Impressive...\n",
       "\n",
       "Sound: 9.5  If you've ever watched a Star Wars movie, you'll know what to expect here. The sound effects, voice-overs and John Williams' trademark soundtrack are all here, and in fine fashion. Thanks to the mini-DVD medium, a Star Wars game on a Nintendo system has never been better. In the advent of the surround-sound home theater, Rogue Leader's ProLogic II surround sound is also welcome. While you have to have a newer receiver to be able to take full advantage of the format, it still sounds very good on my older ProLogic receiver, so good in fact that you can hear the TIE's coming up from behind. It's hard for a game that LOOKS this good to blow you away in the sound area, but let me be the first to say, that Rogue Leader *ALMOST* pulls it off. Most impressive...\n",
       "Gameplay: 8.0  Where many licensed games fall short is the area of gameplay, and there has been more than one Star Wars game to fall prey to that trend. Fortunately, Rogue Leader manages to play extremely well: controls are well-laid out and responsive, while the design, which can be difficult, never seems that overwhelmingly difficult. That being said, there is very little new here. It's basically Rogue Squadron with better graphics after all. Right? Not quite... While the play mechanics of the original are basically unchanged, there are two areas that have been improved upon GREATLY: 1) SPEED & 2) AI. In Rogue Squadron, there were points in the game where you just felt like your X-Wing was literally CRAWLING across the sky. You won't have that sensation here. While your ship still never seems to move as fast as you need it to (remember, the TIE's are faster than just about anything the Rebellion has...even the A-Wings can't quite do it), the sensation of speed is there, particularly when skimming over the surface of a Star Destroyer or some other large-scale obstacle. As for the AI, I'm not so much referring to the forces of the Empire as I am your fellow Rogue Squadron members. You can't depend on them to do all the work, but their reactions to your commands are responsive, as you can actually see them doing the order you just issued.\n",
       "Theme: 10.0  This is a Star Wars game, and if that says anything, it's that there are thousands of (rabid?) fans waiting for more realistic immersion into the Star Wars universe than games have allowed. While Star Wars Galaxies promises role-playing in the classic Star Wars universe early next year, no game captures the speed and epic scale of the space battles of the Star Wars films like Rogue Leader does right now. The scale of the game, the size of the Star Destroyers and Death Star, the swarms of TIE Fighters, it truly is one aspect of the Star Wars experience on a grand scale. With the space expansion of Star Wars Galaxies well over a year away, no other title puts you there like this. You'd need your own astromech droid for it to be any more convincing.\n",
       "Overall: 9.5  While launch titles are almost never considered to be representative of what a hardware platform is capable of, it's hard not to think that Factor 5 has been able to tap into the GameCube's capabilities at an unrivalled degree. By staying with the formula that had proven successful on the N64 with Rogue Squadron (and the lest touted Battle for Naboo), Factor 5 has been able to refine the gameplay for a game that's ultimately very easy to just pick up and play, but difficult enough to master. Perhaps the biggest compliment that can be given to the game though, is that once you have mastered it, you might just want to take it for another spin, if only to take in all the beautiful scenery.</td><td>A2VJJ2POCLMED7</td><td>Marshall Carter</td><td>null</td><td>As close to being on Hoth as you'll ever get...</td><td>1038700800</td><td>false</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>B000MXQ2CU</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Comfortable and fit well!</td><td>A1MNIJEJMDZWK</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>{\"Size:\":\" 38W x 30L\",\"Color:\":\" British Khaki\"}</td><td>Nice pants!</td><td>1500854400</td><td>true</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00005QDPZ</td><td>null</td><td>3.0</td><td>Playing this is essentially as close the films as I can imagine for right now, and that is glorious! My fave level is easily HOTH. However, the plot is told just at screens or in your ship, it's not so well-written. A lot of the levels don't feel too STAR WARS-esque, I think they should have introduced some SW Prequel dogfights into this, along with those ships. The codes are really cool, you can get all sorts of different ships, but they should be easier to input and save so you don't have to do it all the time. I love how the time adjusts in-game to the time that your Gamecube has, so if you're playing at dusk, Tatooine is at dusk also, and that's great. It makes it seem at least somewhat fresh, though they have you do some of the same exact things you did last time out, like race Wedge through the canyon and some missions are nearly the same as well. Voice talent is first rate, they got the actual Wedge and a reliable Mark Hamill impersonator. Ultimately, I feel RS1 was more interesting, more fun, just more exciting, RS2 seems like it should be more fun, and it isn't quite, maybe it was seeing the landscapes of RS1 being done on the N64... At any rate, some levels are great, just like the movies, others are made up and it's not fun to play the made-up levels (or levels from SW books), they aren't distinct as something from STAR WARS, it's like playing any other sci-fi shooter, maybe character interaction is key. I prefer to do what I've seen done in the films, maybe those few fights should have been concentrated on, given a few levels based on one scene, so the graphics could be even better and the gameplay could be more epic. I'd love to play the CLONE WAR in RS3, maybe Rogues weren't really around back then, but they could work around it. Anyway, parts could've been changed, made less mathematical, but it's still a pretty decent thrill.</td><td>AS09CJ2GLNXNV</td><td>D.N.</td><td>null</td><td>Good game, no classic.</td><td>1038355200</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B000MXQ2CU</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Sized properly</td><td>A26E2Y8H0C8N8J</td><td>James P.

The graphics and sound are top notch (incredible is another word that comes to mind) and really pull you in into the game. Control is tight and is easy to work with. In fact I would say, this the one of the best arcade style, flight combat game engines to date. After the first mission you have ten additional campangs to play out, scenes from all three classic trilogy films are represented: the AT-AT battle on Holth, Cloud City, battle of Endore, and of course the final battle to destroy the second Death Star. There are a lot of hidden goodies, if you check the official Rogue Squardron II web-site you'll be able to obtain codes to unlock bonus levels, including ones that let you play on the side of the Empire, what more could you ask for?

My cousin has Rogue Squadron for Nintendo 64, and we thought that it was really hard. Rogue Squadron is laughable compared to Rogue Leader. I haven't played Rogue Squadron for a while.

True, the graphics are most definitely better, (quite possibly the most impressive graphics yet seen on a console) but the game-play just feels archaic and stale. (How many times do I have to trip up AT-AT's with tow cables? Didn't I already do this in Shadows of the empire and Rogue 1?)  There's just really nothing new here and the repetitive die-and-retry game-play really gets old.\n",
       "You see, Rogue Leader is one of those games where in order to advance, you have to do everything exactly like the designers intended you to.  Everything is scripted, and you have to go along with the script line for line and word for word.  Any deviations will be met with an immediate \"game over\" screen.  I would have liked a game with a branching mission structure-as seen in games like Wing Commander and Colony Wars.  For instance if I fail to protect a frigate, then the game still keeps going, but the missions will progress down a different path than they would, had the frigate survived.\n",
       "A branching path system would have given the game much more replay value as well.  I'm sorry, but the medal system in these StarWars games just seems like a cheap gimmick to try to increase the longevity of an otherwise very short game.  Who wants to replay the same level 27 times-trying to achieve perfection-just so you can get a medal to unlock a new ship or secret level?  This just doesn't appeal to me; and if you don't replay the game to get these medals, then Rogue Leader is very VERY short.  With just 11 missions, you'll probably complete the game in 5-10 hours.\n",
       "I have a couple other minor complaints.  One is the feature which automatically realigns your craft with whatever they decide should be up and down for that level.  This is space; there is no up and down.  It can be extremely aggravating when you're on the tail of a couple of ties, and then your X-Wing decides to realign itself causing you to lose sight of them.  Which brings up my other complaint: why can't you lock onto anything?  Why aren't there arrows which point to your target, as there are in nearly every other space-shooter.  The only targeting information your given is a targeting computer (just like the ones in the movies) which comes down and overlays the screen.  You have to hold the Y button in order for it to stay.  This can be quite awkward at times-especially when you need to fire a torpedo.  It really doesn't help you all that much anyway.  It just makes all the enemy targets glow brightly so they're easier to spot.\n",
       "Graphics and sound are pretty much the best features of Rogue Leader.  The graphics are quite stunning, with bump-mapping, reflections, and just about every other bell and whistle you could want.  And it's a StarWars game, so of course it has great sound.\n",
       "I guess I just want Rogue Leader to be something it really isn't trying to be.  StarWars fans who enjoyed Rogue 1 and the Starfighter games, and who want more of the same simple arcade experience, and those who care about nothing but graphics, will probably find a lot to like in Rogue Leader.  Me, I want something new.  I want something deeper.  Purdy graphics slapped on the same tired, repetitive game just don't cut it for me.\n",
       "Sound:  10/10  It's a StarWars game so of course the sound is great.\n",
       "Graphics: 10/10  Quite possibly the most advanced graphics ever seen.\n",
       "Controls:  8/10  The realign feature, and the lack of lock-on-targets is annoying, but other than that everything's fine.\n",
       "Game-play:  4/10  Same old tired repetitive game-play as all the other recent StarWars space-shooters.\n",

RPGs weren't very popular on the GC, due to the fact that those companies thinking it wouldn't sell too greatly on the GC. FPS on Gamecube were awesome. with the controller's design, you don't have to reach any farther for the L stick unlike the PS2. not all games were not to be on the GC and those would be the Dragonball Z Budokai 1 and 2, because you have to keep turning the sticks and doing so ended up with a broken controller. THe Joysticks on the controller shouldn't go through rough play. The Animal Crossing game was a great example of why people who had too much time on their hands because it goes in real time and you can do all sorts of fun stuff. Graphics for some of the games were excellent as well. because this system uses an ATI Video Card, the water effects are georgus. the system had a great collection of retro game classic collections (mainly from sega and Capcom) Zelda the wind waker is the game to have for this system because it's a long adventure in the seas.\n",

This makes multiplatform games harder to put on the Cube since most games are around 3.5gb and the smaller size forces developers to cut out certain parts of a game in order to put it on the Cube.

The Gamecube has a smaller library than the Xbox (even though they were launched around the same date) and the PS2's library trumps both systems. If you like lots of great fighting games, sports games, action games, or RPGs then look elsewhere. One can argue that there are some but for the past couple of years a lot of multiplatform games have just been passing over the Cube. Nintendo develops a fair amount of games itself for the system but the majority of the games are the same franchises that were around for the original NES in the 80s. Nintendo continually focuses on making Mario/Pokemon and other kiddie games for the Cube and continually ignores the tastes of adult gamers over the age of 18. Developers like Capcom, Sega, Square, and Namco have realized that the system sells poorly outside of Japan and are more reluctant to release exclusive titles for the Cube. As a result, many former Gamecube exclusives have jumped over to the Xbox and PS2. Over the past year the number of games being released on the Cube has dropped significantly.

Controls are very easy to learn, and there is a training stage to help you understand and control everything. The sound is great as with all Star Wars games...you get to fly through various worlds and battles from Star Wars...but there are some things that are sort of bad with this game. It may just be my deep personal opinion, but it seems like you're always out there alone. Constantly you hear your teamates crying for help while you're being tailed by tie fighters tearing you a new one. It can get annoying that you have to help everyone on the rebel team, but no one can ever get the stealth tie fighters off your [rear]. Oh well...it's still fun. Of course there are secrets...what game would be complete without secrets!? None I tell you. You have to complete the mission in a certain amount of time and within certain parameters of performance. Based on this, you win a medal. Medals equals points which you can later use to 'buy' bounus stages. And I will flat out tell you that the final stage is the most intense and killer battle I've ever played. You don't have to be a Star Wars fan to follow this game...if you just like to fly around and shoot enemies out of the sky then you too can play this game and enjoy it. One of the cooler things about this game is that you, as the title suggests, are the rogue leader and can control what you want the rest of the squadron fighters to do throughout the mission. Whether it be attacking the oncoming tie fighters or taking out large turret guns firing from bases below, you're in control; a definite plus. The number of ships and features you get to use through out the game make it even more exciting. This game is definitely worth checking out.</td><td>A104Z6CIL5H8S4</td><td>MammaJamma22</td><td>null</td><td>Squadron</td><td>1024790400</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B000MXLYVY</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>This item arrived when expected and was pleased with my purchase.</td><td>A1DE9V5F3GB4P5</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>null</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1431820800</td><td>true</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00005QDPZ</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>One of the best games out there for Nintendo Gamecube, this game has amazing graphics.

Wow.  This game is amazing.  Ever since I've had my GameCube I have had this game, and I still love it.  It brings all the fun and excitement of the original Star Wars movies together with brand new cinematic elements, gameplay, and a totally new look.\n",
       "I'll start with the graphics.  This game has incredibly detailed models, with extremely high polygon ships and detailed backgrounds so real; you'd think it WAS real.  Every time I play this game I am taken back into all those great Star Wars movies from the past.  The game's overall presentation (graphics) is great, the detail is so fine even down to every little gun on a ship.  The previous version of this game had great graphics for the system it was on, the N64.  But the GameCube allows the sequel to exceed far belong anyone's expectations.  It definitely exceeded mine, and I'm still wowed by this game whenever I experience it again or simply just look at the gameplay.  It amazes me.\n",
       "Next, the sound.  Every single detail is included in this game in terms of sound.  It uses the MusyX sound system, which provides crisp, clear, stereo-quality sound.  The sound quality is nearly perfect; there is no recognizable static or unclear sound.  The sound effects are not over-used nor under-used; it is just the right amount.  The sound effects are one of the best parts about this game.  Everything from the flash of lasers firing, to the explosions of ships that you have just demolished.  It brings a much more satisfying feeling to you than just seeing the visuals.\n",
       "The music in this game is also great.  Nearly all the music has been re-recorded to complement the game.  John Williams's masterpieces can make you hum the tunes over and over and over again.  They are great, and the music is not over-used in the game either though.  The music provides an excellent background for the game.\n",
       "Now, the gameplay.  The interface of the game is great, the menus can be easily navigated, and there are even clips from previous Star Wars movies playing in the backgrounds of the menus!  The controls are absolutely perfect, no doubt about it.  Although they can be fairly difficult at first, once you learn them, you will be a professional at the game!  The ships are navigated just like a regular cockpit, and there is a cockpit view, too!  The ships interact with each other in a great way, and the game is extremely fun!  The AI in this game is absolutely incredible.  The enemy ships actually act as if there is a highly intelligent pilot behind the \"wheel\".  There is almost nothing that I would change about the gameplay in this game.  It is highly enjoyable.\n",
       "The value in this game is its only weak point.  The longevity of this game is not as good as it should be.  A multiplayer mode needs to be in this game.  Once you beat the game, there's not a whole lot that you can do with it.  There is the option of getting all the gold and platinum medals for every level, but that is so ridiculously hard that it hardly seems worth it.  This game was at its peak fun level when I was still trying to beat all of the ordinary ten or so levels.  There are five extra bonus levels, but they can only be obtained by getting a certain amount of the medals on the ordinary levels.  WARNING:  This game is fairly difficult and I recommend you should be at least eight years old to play it.  Of course, younger kids could play it, but it would probably be very hard for them.\n",
       "Star Wars Rogue Squadron II is a great game.  I recommend it to any hardcore gamer that likes this type of game and likes one player gaming.  The only addition that I think there should be with this game is for a multiplayer mode.  I think it would be perfect if it had this.\n",
       "Overall, Rogue Squadron II is incredible.  It brings back all the fun and excitement of the original Star Wars movies and puts these events from the movies into your control!  Lucas Arts has put together an absolutely magnificent game.  I hope this review can sway someone's opinion about the game.\n",

I have had to go through two PS2's because the quality sucks terribly.  They break within a year while Gamecube lasts a heck of a lot longer.  My Gamecube (which I got before my first PS2) is still going after 2-3 years, which is should be.  Gamecube is fine while the my first PS2 which should still be working isn't.  No system should die on you within a year and for that I say PS2's Quality SUCKS!

       "Next to Halo, Rogue Leader is probably the greatest console game on the market, and possibly one of the best ever made.  The graphics are pristine, the gameplay is excellent and it captures the Star Wars atmosphere perfectly.  While I wasn't a big fan of the first Rogue Squadron because it sometimes degenerated into arcade-like silliness, the sequel seems to have the best elements of an arcade style shooter combined with some of the features of the X-Wing games for the PC.  The result is an immersive, compelling game with lots of twists and turns.\n",
       "It's not all flowers and sunshine, unfortunately, and there are a couple of small missteps that keep me from giving this game that fifth star it deserves on the single player missions alone.  The biggest flaw and one that is slowly becoming the death of more and more games out there is the lack of a multiplayer element.  Obviously this limits replayability, but what really bothers me is the fact that this could have been the \"Halo\" of the Gamecube.  Unfortunately, without utilising those three other joystick inputs, Rogue Leader doesn't live up to it's full potential.\n",
       "Rogue Leader could have had better music at times as well.  It seems to rely on midi-type music that makes John Williams incredible score sound thin and computerised.  The only other flaw, a small one, is that I think the game could have used some additional point of views and customizeable controls.  People used to the X-Wing games on the PC might have an easier time mastering the game.\n",
       "I know this soudns like a lot of complaints, but considering the strengths, they're really small potatos.  The missions, dog-fights, maps, backgrounds, and all the visual elements are almost flawless.  There are lots of unlockable missions like navigating the Millenium Falcon through the asteroid field, that will compell you to play a mission over and over to get them right.  The gameplay is far more challenging than your usual batch of arcade shooters and the variety of vehicles keeps them from getting tedius.  If you're a Star Wars fan, you'll probably be hooked the first time you fly along the surface of the Death Star or take out an AT-AT with your tow-cables.

While the initial set of launch games does keep the Mario series going with Luigi's Mansion, Rogue Leader is Nintendo's crown jewel for the GameCube and it plays like it.  Some Star Wars games have show the tendency to be very mediocre and disappointing (Rebel Assault II comes to mind), but I was pleasantly surprised with quality and replay value of the original Rogue Squadron for N64.  The challenge wasn't only in beating the game, it was in obtaining gold medals on each of the levels in the game.  The challenge of obtaining the medals (bronze, silver, and gold) drove me to keep playing each board even after defeating it.  It made me a more disciplined player and gave me a greater sense of satisfaction when I achieved the desired medal.  I eventually got all the gold medals around the time that talk of the sequel, Rogue Leader, was getting started up.  As soon as I got the GameCube for Christmas, I made sure Rogue Leader was the first game I bought.  What an amazing game!!!  The graphics are unparalleled on any game on any platform that I have seen (and this includes Playstation 2 and X-Box).  Unlike Rogue Squadron, which followed a storyline in a time period independent of the movies, Rogue Leader's storyline runs parallel to the original trilogy.  As a result, the gameplayer gets engage in battles above the original Death Star (including the spectacular trench run), Hoth, Bespin, Endor, and the second Death Star.  Additionally, the other boards focus on events hinted at in the movies or literature about that time period in the Star Wars Universe (Vengeance at Kothlis is one of my favorites of that bunch).  All told, there are 10 main levels, 1 Tatooine Training Mission level, and 5 bonus missions (which can only be unlocked using the points accrued by obtaining medals on each of the main levels and subsequent unlocked bonus levels).  It should be noted that two of the bonus levels are fascinating alternate reality scenarios where you get to fly Darth Vader's tie fighter and destroy rebel ships above the Death Star and then destroy there base on Yavin.  The final bonus level is the \"Endurance\" stage where you fight above the Death Star and have to destroy 99(!) waves of Imperial fighters.  There's a little trick to do so and once you figure it out, the only challenge is just investing the time to defeat the board (it's taken me 4 hours, but a Gold Medal is all but assured if you defeat all the waves).  The Tatooine Training mission is not required for any of the regular or bonus mission goals (though completing it during 4 separate time periods is required for unlocking ACE mode), but it is a very good way to get familiarized with the game controls and the types of techniques you can and will need to use during the regular missions.  If I have any quibble with the game, and it's only a minor one, it's that Rogue Leader doesn't give you much (i.e. nothing at all) in terms of fanfare for achieving all the Gold Medals or all the ACE Medals.  At least the original Rogue Squadron gave you a little fireworks celebration.  But, I digress.  It's a tiny complaint that cannot even begin to detract from overall superior quality of this game.  Nintendo continues to get it right and continues to justify my support of them as the game system of choice.</td><td>AUDSM2CTLLW1Q</td><td>Irish</td><td>null</td><td>GameCube Launches in Style</td><td>1022803200</td><td>false</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>B000MXIN22</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>A bit baggy for a 36 waist...but I can live with it.

Your fellow rebel pilots seem to suffer from a severe incompetence disorder, including Lando (a General!) who refuses to fire a shot at a single TIE on his back. You tell your wingmen to help with the fighters menacing you and the medical frigate, and seconds later you are blown to pieces. Everyone calling for help in the game addresses you and you alone, because your squadron-mates are seeing if their R-droids can make a Gin and Tonic.

I have to say that this game is, without a doubt, the absolute best Star Wars game ever made.  The usual factors to consider are the graphics and sound effects, both of which are astounding.  This game takes full advantage of the Gamecubes' abilities.  In the N64 game \"Rogue Squadron\", when the X-Wing fighter fired the blasters, a shot was issued from all four cannons at once.  In this game, the four cannons fire independently of each other, one at a time.  This gives you a constant barrage of fire that is far better than what we had before.  The ships and backgrounds all appear exactly as they did in the films, and all sounds are faithfully reproduced in every detail.  Each ship in the game has a \"behind the ship\" view and a \"cockpit\" view.  In the cockpit view, the yellow \"C\" joystick acts as your head, allowing you to look right, left, up or down as you fly.  Every detail that you can think of is here.  For example, at one point in the game you get to steal a TIE Fighter.  When switching to the cockpit view in that ship, you get to hear that \"hum\" that was heard every time a close-up of a TIE Fighter Pilot was shown flying his ship in the movies.  It's details like that that makes this game a winner, but there's more to it than that.\n",
       "One of this game's best qualities is that it has great replay value.  There are 10 main missions in the game, but 15 missions overall.  There are also several bonus ships that can be unlocked and used in certain missions.  Players can gain access to the 5 bonus missions by meeting performance standards in the missions they have access to (including any previously opened bonus missions) and being awarded bronze, silver or gold medals, with a maximum of 10 points per level.  The points are then \"cashed in\" to open the bonus missions.  The factors that the medals are based on include mission completion time, shot accuracy, and the number of enemies destroyed, among other things.  The requirements for winning medals sometimes seem comparable to winning the \"Triple Crown\" in Major League Baseball.  It seems you can excel in certain areas, while falling short in others. But there is no penalty for repeated failures to meet the requirements for medals, and all of them can be obtained eventually with enough practice.  I'm winning gold medals on missions that a few weeks ago I had deemed it impossible to do so.  The way to do it is just to pick a level and keep plugging away at it, time after time, until you finally win the gold medal.  And you will sooner or later, trust me.\n",
       "Bronze and silver medals are obtainable fairly easily with a little effort, but the gold ones are designed for only the most disciplined and determined players.  But the rewards for winning them will keep you playing for hours on end.  As of this writing I have access to 14 levels, and have 11 gold medals around my neck.  As soon as I upgrade the remaining 3 silver medals to gold, I will have enough points to open the final bonus mission, \"Endurance.\"  Once I win the gold medal in that mission, I will gain access to the \"Ace\" mode, which is a whole new ballgame.  I have a feeling that I'm not nearly done with this game, and I've already gotten my money's worth out of it.  My medals and performance thus far has earned me the Slave 1, Millenium Falcon and TIE Fighter bonus ships, and there are still more out there left to get I understand.\n",

The games that are made by Nintendo are great. Such titles as Metroid Prime 2 and certainly the Zelda series are what give the Gamecube variety in it's games. The PS2 has games that have the same story, in a way. (For instance: Rachet&Clank, Jak&Daxter.) Also, most of the PS2 and Xbox games that are made only for that certain console are side games, not the ones that have an original storyline, and are engageing to play. The graphics are as good as or better than the Xbox or the PS2. In addition, the speed is much faster than that of the other two. It takes at average to load a game, about two seconds; at max, about ten seconds. You would think that with the $200 price tag on the Xbox and the PS2 would make it a fast console. (It takes, what, three minutes to load a game with the Xbox?)The PS2 has bad Playstation-only games. The only good and popular game only for Xbox is the Halo series. On the Nintendo Gamecube, you have Nintendo-only games that are engageing, fun, and worth buying. (For Example:Super Smash Bros. Melee) Most good games, like Grand Theft Auto, or Need for Speed, are on all of the consoles.

Playstation 2 is not great system in contrast with xbox and gamecube. Xbox is bettter than playstation 2 in the controller department. Anyone using the playstation 2 controller is asking for arthritis. Having cheap buttons where triggers are supposed to be the xbox has supreme quality. Having 6 action buttons right at your disposal with your thumb. The analog sticks are much better also. Ps2 sticks feel like a piece a styrofoam carved at shoved in the slot. Talk about cheap. Sony is just in it for the money. Not to mention automatic game saves to the HD and the optional chance to buy a memory card kicks sony's ass in the convinience department. In the library department ps2 may be for you if you like  vast choice. But Xbox does have way more quality games than ps2. Quality>Quantity. You will have much more choices in quality games such as KOTOR, Halo 2, Halo, Ninja Gaiden, Mechassault 1&2, Crimson skies, and much much more. In the durability department xbox takes the lead again. It seems as though ps2 is going to fall apart especially when it makes that loud, rattling noise when it is under heavy loading sequences. and anyone says the ps2 is more portable than xbox than they need to get off their lazy ass and go to the gym. Ps2 is not that much smaller than xbox. Actually, Xbox is more portable since it can actually take a good beating, hazards that will probably happen if you drop your ps2. In summary, you probably can tell which is better Xbox>ps2. It's that simple. Really.\n",

Take for example Halo 2, very fun and addicting to play online, but campaign sucks.  Also, some people might not want to pay to go online.

I love to game and the GameCube gives me everything I could want or need in a system.\n",
       "\n",
       "Let's get to it. First off the price of the system is unbeatable. Especially if you decided to go with a bundle which comes with an extra controller and a game. The system seems rather durable and I get comments from my brother-in-law, who is a PS2 owner, about how FAST my GameCube boots up and how fast you can just start gaming. As for my gaming tastes, well, they aren't \"kiddie\". I like Metroid Prime, Prince of Persia, Viewtiful Joe, Eternal Darkness, Baten Kaitos, Tales of Symphonia, and Resident Evil. That's just to name a FEW! The Resident Evil series is why I purchased the 'Cube in the first place. You may get some reviewers saying you get more mature games on the PS2 or Xbox. Their definition of mature includes scantily dressed characters, terrible game concepts like having the ability to kill prostitutes, and outrageous sexual references. In this case, they are correct. The 'Cube doesn't offer a lot of these types of games. What Nintendo has developed is a very family friendly console which is ALL ABOUT THE GAMES! With franchise characters such as Mario, Donkey Kong, and Zelda Nintendo offers TONS of games for the younger members of your family. Remember... Nintendo PIONEERED the home console and they understand games.\n",

       "I wish there were more online games for the 'Cube. It does have a broadband adapter you can purchase as an accessory however there aren't many games you can use with it. But that's my only complaint. I love my GameCube so much that my next console will be one from Nintendo as well.\n",

They have Zelda, Mario, and Metroid Prime 1&2 to name a few, but they also have excellent third party games such as Madden, NBA Live, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, WWE: Day of Reckoning, and countless others. For you mature gamers you have Eternal Darkness, Resident Evil, Mortal Kombat, etc. So everyone get this myth out of your head, THIS IS NOT A KID'S SYSTEM! Sure it has games tailored to kids but it has plenty to keep older gamers coming back for more.\n",
       "\n",
       "I think the Gamecube controller is excellent. It is a bit different but you will find that the button scheme works well on all but just a couple of games. It works about as well as the PS2 controller, and we won't even discuss the mammoth XBox controller.\n",
       "\n",
       "The only real drawback is the lack of online play, but that isn't particularly devastating. The fact that there are four controller ports (as opposed to just 2 on the other systems) and several addictive four player games more than makes up for that. If, however, you really enjoy playing online PS2 would be the way to go.\n",
       "\n",

What I don't want to see are people that have never played the NGC spouting that it sucks, because people depend on these reviews to make an important decision and I feel it is an injustice to comment on something for which you have little knowledge about.

My friend has one, and all of the games are crap.  The only good game I've found on XBox is Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee.  The PS2 may have perfect graphics, but games are limited to good choice, and commercial advertisement for Soul Calibur 2 says each system had its own personal qualities.  Gamecube has sharper graphics than PS2, PS2 had best controls, and XBox had best gameplay flow.  See?  Gamecube has sharper graphics, a great selection of games (personally, My favorite games are Metroid Prime, Super Smash Bros. Melee, and Super Mario Sunshine.)and great multiplayer games as well.  No need to go out and buy that multitap for your PS2, it's already built in. No need to try and find controllers that have different colors for that XBox, there aren't any, but Gamecube has a small but good selection of controller colors.  See?

A cute little cube with an awesomely comfortable controller and great hardware. And not to mention the unbeateable software. It's quite logical for Nintendo to make the best systems anyway.

       "Now, every good gamer know that it's gameplay and fun that makes a game great, not graphics (remember 'The Legend of Zelda' for NES? Now THAT was a system seller!). Lots of people praise the XBox with blind devotion because it has the best graphics chips and processors and all the raw materials to be a good system. But where are the good games? There aren't any. All the games for XBox look more like projects that school kids developed in a hurry rather than professional gaming products. Microsoft won't admit it, but their console is going to end up just like the DreamCast, at the bottom of a landfill. The PlayStation 2 is certainly a good system as was the PSone.

       "After at least six continuous hours of playing it, I can unequivocally state that not only is this the best Gamecube title I've played, it's very possibly one of the best console games ever!\n",
       "I believe that, for the most part, console games are a trade off. Does the developer concentrate on gameplay and speed at the expense of graphics and sound or vice versa? This goes back to the Nintendo/Sega 16-bit console wars. Nintendo hyped its Super NES' graphics while Sega's Genesis boasted it's superior speed (remember the Genesis tagline: \"Genesis does what Ninten-Don't?\") To an extent, that was true; the SNES suffered from a very noticeable slowdown when too many graphics were rendered on the screen simultaneously.  By comparison, Genesis' graphics ranged from mediocre to abysmal. But, it was faster. A lot faster.\n",
       "Well, with Rogue Squadron II, that trade off is a moot point. Everything is beautiful! The sound is amazing (I found myself having to adjust my stereo's EQ settings, which I've never had to do for any game,) the graphics are stunnung, and the video quality of the film clips in the menu screens is crystal clear and glitch-free, which is surprising since there's so much going on.\n",
       "And the gameplay? In one word: flawless! The Gamecube controller looks complex and confusing, and Rogue Squadron II makes use of nearly every single button. But, after an hour, I had the hang of it, which helped tremendously with other titles.\n",
       "I've got a few new titles for PC and even though I have a dual AMD Thunderbird processor box with a GeForce 3 card, none - NONE of those titles (including Max Payne) can compare. I've been to a few XBox and PS2 forums and have read messages from owners of those consoles calling the Gamecube the weakest console system, but evidently they never played Rogue Squadron II.

Everything about it, the graphics, sound, controls, story, and even voices are good. From the moment the GameCube intro movie passes, you are entertained. Even before you have to pick up the controller, you see stormtroopers forming in the LucasArts logo dancing to the Mos Eisley cantina music. From then on, it is sheer bliss. The controls take a little while to get used to, but after that brief learning period they are second nature. Your thumbs and index fingers flow perfectly to the correct buttons, and never once do you need to check where they are. The movies of this game just don't do the sound and picture justice, you won't even notice that you aren't playing the movie most of the time. The voice-overs are well done and placed, Factor 5 (the developers) even got the real voice of Wedge Antilles to do his voice. The only reason why I give this game four stars is because of the difficulty level. You can be stuck on a level for days at a time, and then you can forget about a gold medal until you replay it with about a thousand more times, and that's with all the upgrades you can find. The lack of a multiplayer option is a minimal inconvenience, as it would detract from the experience in the rest of the game. Many people would end their review with \"May the Force be With You!\" but that's just to cheesy for me.

Gamecube doesnt have the best selection for everyone, but for the most part, you can find many games that will suit your taste.  The controller isn't really as bad as alot of people say. Look at the Xbox, it may have a Dreamcast sized controller, but you will get used to it.  Gamecube has a growing library of games, as o the other consoles too.  Im not going to list any of them, since you may not like the same games I do. Plus if you want something that can play DVD's, CD's, and store MP3's, its called you PC.  If it cant play DVD's you can easily get a DVD drive for it these days.  Ok, and to clear up some things that people are still fighting about: 1.  Xbox does not have the most powerful CPU, it has a 32 bit P3 chip (and yes, its 32 bit, windows is a 32 bit OS).  Ps2 has the 'worst graphics' because it is a couple years older then the other 2, and vector unit processing is hard to program.  Last, the console you have won't just 'freeze up' if you don't toss it around, and keep it clean from dust.  ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT IT HAS PROPER VENTING!!!  ok, Im done ranting.

Nintendo's in-house franchises familiar to nearly everyone who likes video games (Mario, Zelda, Metroid, F-Zero), some new exclusives (Viewtiful Joe, Resident Evil -- the main storyline) and some excellent multiplatform titles (Prince of Persia, Soul Calibur 2, Splinter Cell) makes this system worth owning.\n",

I always thought of the Gamecube as the worst of the current three consoles, but actually owning one made me realise its one of the worst consoles ever. The Xbox Controller S is one of the best controllers ever, and the PS2 controller isn't so bad...but the Gamecube controller is horrific. Never have I seen or held such a terrible controller. It feels totally wrong and looks even worse. The original controller's cord is also terribly short. The startup screen for the system and the menu screen are also disgusting, especially when you compare them to a system like the Xbox. The system can't play DVDs or audio cds, unlike the other two competitors. Every extra capability must be purchased as an addon. There are only two memory card slots compared to Xbox's two slots PER controller. Even the power cord sucks, with its large adapter. There are a few positive points however, such as the very compact size of the system, the nice, small size of the Gamecube discs and standard 4 controller ports. However, these small extras don't make up for the absolute nonsense the actual system is. The exclusive games, however, are fantastic and make the system worth it.

       "Now I mean it, the graphics are a perfect 10/10, it looks and even sounds like you are playing the movie, right down to the scratches on the surface of the massive Star Detroyer as it spits out dozens of Tie Fighters at you.\n",
       "That being said, as far as replay value and interesting bonuses, there is nothing it has over the original version of the game. It is much harder, the secrets are FEWER and more painstaking to unlock, and the controls leave much to be desired. Often you can't tell if your ship is speeding up or slowing down when you press brake or speed boost- it usually just cruises along at the generic speed it's stuck on. And if a craft starts following you, the \"camera angle\" suddenly and awkwardly forces your ship far away and puts the pursuing vehicle in the foreground, making depth perception impossible. Missions with a great deal of Tie Fighters get old really fast when you can't tell if you're going to crash into something because your ship is just a tiny speck in the distance.\n",
       "Also, although it is freeing and fun to fly missions in outer space more often instead of over land (like so many levels in Rogue Squadron 1) there is a lot of debris in outer space levels. So much, in fact, that often you have to use an infra-red-like targeting screen to find enemies to shoot at, making the outstanding graphics work done on the spacecraft and backgrounds pointlessly dark and distorted. There is an awesome-looking level in a nebula cloud, but you'll lose if you look at it for more than half a second.\n",
       "It also would have been nice to have some kind of story, or at least a pilot with a \"career\" of sorts like in the original PC X-Wing game that came out in the mid-nineties. As it is, your only rewards for playing this game are getting to fly different vehicles in levels you already played for hours till they drove you crazy, a few unlockable levels that are pretty neat looking but are only entertaining until you beat them, and the old bronze/silver/gold medal thing from the first Rogue Squadron game that does nothing but rank you in an Arcade-like Top Score list.\n",

       "\"Those familiar with the Rogue Squadron series will feel right at home in Rogue Leader II. Its menus are nearly identical to its predecessors with the addition of some memorable movie clips playing at certain places. And yes, Leia in the slave outfit is one of them. Missions are also much like the N64 version in terms of length and difficulty. The missions span the story of the first trilogy (Eps. 4-6), beginning with the destruction of the Death Star and finishing with the destruction of Death Star 2:The Wrath of Lando. There are 11 standard missions in the game, with about five being too easy for a Rogue Squadron veteran. Sure, you can always go back and play the level twenty times...trying to shave three seconds off your time and get the gold medal. Somehow I just find that less satisfying than trying over and over to beat a truly challenging mission.\n",

       "Now for the cons of buying a Nintendo GameCube sytem:\n",
       "1. Memory Card. This may sound a little strange, but I think that the Microsoft X-Box has a large advantage over the GameCube because it comes with a built-in hard drive, so game data is saved on the X-Box console, not onto an expensive memory card that will not hold a lot of data.\n",
       "2. Reputation. Since the Nintendo GameCube's early days, it has developed a reputation as a \"nerd system\". I personally think that it is not meant to be, but this reputation has spread to game developers, which has dealt a gigantic blow to Nintendo's third party support. For example, the 2K series, (e.g. NBA 2K3 and NFL 2K3) have decided not to publish their 2K4 versions of games for GameCube, only Playstation 2 and X-Box, when the games were made for the GameCube the previous year.\n",

However, the GameCube is the console most underated in the market. In terms of graphics, GC can provide stunning graphics that both PS2 and XBox cannot offer. People were so mislead by all the specs publication wars which actually Nintendo was not interested in at all. Look at games like Metroid Prime, Wave Racer, Red Squaldron etc. you will know what GC can offer. However, the whole world is just to distracted by graphics of games, which in way thought that as long as the game as good graphics, it is a good game, which is SO SO NOT TRUE. A game is about game play, and this is what makes a game re-visitable or not. Among all the game libraries provided by different consoles, there is no doubt that PS2 has the biggest library but at the same has the most junk games available. For XBox, most stuff are port from PS2 and at the same time has pathetic games like DOA Beach Volley which encourage players to be obssessed with the virtual body and manipulation of CG girls. For Nintendo, you can find the most innovative games in store: Eternal Darkness redefine the way survival thriller should be played, Metroid Prime redefine the game play of the series per se, Animal Crossing provides the most interesting interactive expereinces, Zelda Wind Waker provides you the most environmental related RPG format, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles provides innovative Multiplayer RPG experience. People should give GC a go before criticising GC as a kid console. Just imagine games like PN03, Killer 7, Eternal Darkness and Viewtiful Joe are not kid games at all.

       "I will qualify this review for you - I am not very good at flying games. I am much better at sports games, strategy games, and an occasional adventure here and there. Even driving games weren't my style until Gran Turismo 3 came along for the PS2. Like my experience with SSX for the PS2, this game came as part of a bundle, and it wasn't one I thought I'd really enjoy. Unlike SSX, Rogue Squadron II has failed to draw me in.\n",
       "If you've played Rogue Squadron on the N64, you'll have an idea of what to expect - pick a specific ship, choose your mission (in this version, you start with two choices, a training mission and your first real one), and complete your objectives to earn a medal and unlock the next objective. Do better at the same mission and earn a better medal. Get enough medals and other good things happen. Simple enough to explain, and easy enough to follow. The early missions spell out your objectives fairly well, although there may be more details that you'll need to learn as you proceed.\n",
       "The graphics are excellent, from the shadows of your craft on Tatooine, to the dogfights over the Death Star with asteroids floating in the background, to the recreation of scenes from the various movies in the Options menu. If you are watching, you'll definitely get your money's worth. If you're playing, you'll need to remind yourself to stay focused.\n",
       "The game play is well done, too - you'll find yourself leaning to one side or another to avoid oncoming TIEs, leaning back to pull up as you barely avoid crashing into the side of Beggar's Canyon, and wondering how the heck you're supposed to keep track of 20 enemy craft, space objects, and numerous enemy ground support. Don't worry, though, because you'll get help on some missions. As in previous games, you can ask your wingmen to stay in formation with you or pursue other objectives as you take care of business yourself. I didn't have too much trouble directing them with the D-pad, but you will have to make sure that you don't suddenly swing to the side and see one of them in your sights.\n",
       "The game play is good, all right - too good for me. In the first mission, flying through the trench in the Death Star proved to be costly again and again. I found myself consistently burning up my three ships (you can die up to three times before your game is over, although dying too many times will jeopardize your chances at better medals) trying to move up and down around the obstacles while avoiding the lasers from Darth Vader and his helpers. The various craft respond a little too realistically for my taste, and in the training mission on Tatooine, I found myself cursing the controls as I tried unsuccessfully to keep up with Wedge and Biggs, watching their computer-controlled craft easing past me race after race. Perhaps some of it is simply my being accustomed to the response of a car on the road - much less inertia and much more control.\n",
       "In any event, I found it difficult to sit down and play the missions again and again. One of the drawbacks or challenges to the multi-part missions is that you have to complete all the parts to finish the mission. Make it through the first two, fail the third, and you're back to square one. It reminds me a bit of Dark Forces on the PC, which was infamous for its exceedingly long levels later in the game that provided no save opportunities until they were completed.\n",
       "Again, though, this was based strongly on personal preference. If you are a fan of Star Wars, air combat games, or both, you'll probably love this game. In any event, if you're getting a GameCube bundle, you're not going to have much choice. The advantage in a seller's market is that you can certainly sell it if you don't want to keep it!

While the graphics and sound are dazzling, and story is true to the Star Wars universe, this game was a big disappointment to me.  Simply put, I found it to be ridiculously hard.  Which leads to replaying a mission level over and over.  After awhile, that simply becomes frustrating and takes the fun completely out of it.  Most of the missions are broken into sub-missions with cutscenes in between.  Essentially you're given 3 chances to complete a mission and once you've lost 3 ships, it's back to the beginning to start the whole thing over. There are no save points at the end of the sub-missions.  After playing the same sub-mission over and over, only to die later in the same level, the game quickly loses its appeal.  Of course the other factor is time.  Not only are you battling enemies, you're also battling the clock.  So even when you don't die, you often fail because of time constraints.\n",
       " I readily admit that my skill level is below that of many gamers, and as you can see, most people like this game.  A \"save at any point\" feature would have gone a long way towards enhancing my game experience but unfortunately it wasn't designed that way.

The Gamecube also has a wireless controller and an LCD screen, which is pretty handy for traveling when you consider the size of the console itself, which is tiny compared with the PS2, Xbox, and even N64 and other older consoles. As for the graphics, they are better then PS2 (the most dated of the consoles) and a bit worse compared with the Xbox, most advanced of the three. Overall, the Gamecube's graphics are worthy of any console fans. It is not without it's disadvantages, though. It requires a memory card for saving, and these come in two sizes, 59 and 251 blocks.

Gamecube has exclusive titles that are very good (Metroid Prime, Pikmin, Resident Evil, Mario, Zelda.) The DVD/CD is on the down side, but problems do exist with the PS2's DVD, and you have to buy a remote for the Xbox. I love the GCN controller except for it's lack of buttons. The connectivity with the Game Boy Advance is a plus. Gamecube drops in the online category, but paying for a monthly service really doesn't appeal to me. The Gamecube has a fair release forecast with Rogue Squadron III, Pikmin 2, Mario Kart, Final Fantasy CC, and Metroid 2. My second console choice would be the Xbox. The Controller-S is a big improvement from the original controller. The Xbox controller is best in my opinion. DVD capabilities add to the Xbox's power, and there is no need for memory cards because of it's built in hard drive. The Xbox dominates the online world with Xbox Live. Xbox has a strong line-up of games (Halo, Metal Gear Solid, ummmm...oh yea Splinter Cell), and a good selection of upcoming games (Halo 2, Perfect Dark, Splinter Cell 2). In last but fairly close is the Playstation 2. The ability to play the hundreds of PS One games is awesome and the DVD function is okay. The PS2 is the least powerful machine but it still performs up to par with the GCN and XBOX. Online play is standard with good games (Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy, Grand Theft Auto). I'm sure Sony will keep Final Fantasy and GTA alive especially with the upcoming release of the Playstation Portable. My advice: Don't buy a Playstation 2 just yet. Sony is releasing a PSX, which is an advanced PS2. The PSX doesn't have DVD problems and it can record your favorite television shows on it's 120GB hard drive. First, buy a Gamecube.

The graphics seem all edgy and ridged. The gamecube is much better but still not as good as the Xbox. Finally, the Xbox has much more fluid gameplay than the other systems.

Now, for some games the GC has better graphics than PS2, or Xbox, but not always.  Sony also has the best overall design for controllers, too.  And you people who like to type about how good the specs are should realize that the numbers don't always mean how good the system is.  I mentioned this in my other review (for PS2), although GC is 480 MHz, and Ps2 is 350 MHz, Ps2 can do alot more than 350 MHz worth the calculations (same reason why the IBM Deep Blue can do 1 trillion operations, and it runs at 175 MHZ), and its graphics chip is able to make more polygons than GC.  The Ps2 is just harder to get good graphics from since it is alot more complex than GC is, as it uses the Emotions Engine, and 2 Vector Units (VU0, VU1).  So it can be weaker when it comes to the graphics.  And another thing, no system has 100% lag free games, there is always some spots where the processor lags.  Lastly, no console is the best, they all are about equal when it comes down to the processing power. What really matters is the GAMES.  If GC is so much better than Ps2 and Xbox, then why does it sell a little better than Xbox, and Ps2 still blows it away?.  See, the games are what matters, and PS2 has the right mix of them to win.  If you look at it, Ps2 has won the Next Gen console wars.  Once the newer systems come out, all of the consoles now will be obsolete soon anyway.  So, it comes down to personal preference. I am not saying one console is better than the other, I am still just puttin down some true info.  In other words, don't listen to the total GC, PS2, or Xbox fans, play the console yourself and decide what one you like best and buy it.  You know the fans from other consoles will say anything they can to make the others look back, simply because they are insecure about their own system, and are jealous of another.  I personally like all of the consoles, but when I say that Ps2 has won, I mean Sony in general, since they have dominated the market since the realease of the Playstation.

It fits your hand perfectly, which gives you a much better gaming experience. The disks for gamecube are tiny, which i like a lot, its different from the other cds.

There are two drawbacks, however, that will be holding Nintendo back in the current console race.  First, the lack of RPGs.  Most gamers remember the days when you could play the latest Final Fantasy or Dragon Warrior game only on Nintendo.  Sadly, this is no longer the case.  There are, currently, only a handful of RPG titles for the Gamecube.  Second, the lack of a stable online environment for play.

The GameCube is an excellent second console if you already own one of the others. Nintendo made the GameCube to be powerful but inexpensive, [money amount]cheaper than the other two.

That's just the way it is, learn to live with it.\n",
       "Gamecube is not the most popular system is around. However, this means little to the quality of the console, and says more about the way it has been promoted, and the general image of it that the public has. One of these ideas is that the Gamecube is a \"kid's machine\". While it is true that Nintendo's console has exclusive franchises such as Mario, which are -suitable- for children (and apparently geared towards kids too), that doesn't mean that older gamers are forbidden from enjoying them. Anyone that thinks they'd get laughed at for playing these so-called \"kids games\" needs to care less of what people who judge them on the video games they play think and play the sort of games they enjoy playing.\n",
       "lemme tell you why the GameCube is IMO the best choice if you have to own a single console. PS2 is good, but not my thing. Of course, like any console, it has great games, many of which are multi-format. This means that they'll probably also appear on Gamecube, too, usually better than the PS2 versions.\n",
       "But, I hear you say, \"wait a minute, Xbox will have better still versions of these multi-format games!\". This is true a lot of the time - however, what Xbox doesn't have is Gamecube's excellent controller (the Controller S is excellent too, but there is no official wireless controller on Xbox like the Wavebird for Gamecube), nor does it have Gamecube's exclusive games. Xbox and PS2 both have excellent exclusive games (Halo, ICO), and great multi-platform games, but IMO Gamecube has the better exclusives. Will you ever see Zelda, F-Zero, Eternal Darkness, Mario Sunshine, Monkey Ball, Billy Hatcher (looks awesome), Viewtiful Joe and Killer 7 on PS2 or Xbox? Nope...\n",
       "Anti-Cube Argument #1: \"Grand Theft Auto\". I didn't really enjoy this game - really. Sony apparently lose the exclusive rights to this at the end of 2004 (or is it 2003?) so a port to Gamecube is possible then. Don't cross your fingers. If you HAVE to have GTA then go ahead, buy a PS2.\n",
       "Anti-Cube Argument #2: \"It can't play DVDs or music CDs!\" Let's be honest, playing CDs on your console is a gimmick. You can play  CDs on your computer, CD player, toaster, DVD player, etc. DVD playback on a console is useful but I already own a multi-region DVD player that also plays Video-CD and SVCD too (wink). I would have no use for another.\n",

I don't know who said they rather play the Atari instead of the PS2, if he had one, he'd definitly be playing the PS2, mabe more than the Xbox, but who knows.

The missions are fairly simple, but achieving that coveted gold is not.  The hardest missions are the final two, Battle at Endor and Strike at the Core.

Lucasarts was very smart to have this game deal with the original Star Wars trilogy since that, in my mind, is the best of whatever else Star Wars movies can come out.  The graphics of the game were outstanding and show what the Nintendo GameCube is capable of doing, much more so than Luigi's Mansion, with lighting, sound effects, music, graphics, etc.  Lucasarts was again bright to allow us, the players, to be able to fly our favorite crafts in the three most famous battles of the original trilogy:  The Battle of Yavin, Battle of Hoth, and Battle of Endor.  For me, the Battle of Endor was the best, since the level is so huge, fighters and larger ships are everywhere, and they are drawn to scale with each other, definitely.  The game is also very good in that it allows players to do what they may have wanted to do in a long time, like take for example, take out a Imperial Star Destroyer with a lone X-Wing or B-Wing, and in the Battle of Endor you have to take out two, as well as take one out (which is pretty hard with turbolasers and fighters all over the place)in a different level.

The PS2 is bigger, but is thin, so it's got the next best size, the X-BOX however, has a size problem.  It's pretty big, making it the worst, size-wize.  Graphical power comes at a price.\n",

       "Graphics\n",
       "Over PS2, GC has pretty good graphics.  There is a nice framerate in all the games, and there's never really been a problem with good games, graphic-wise.  PS2 has very good graphics, but nowadays, I think that GC is beginning to get better graphics.  X-BOX will have better graphics for now.  It is the most powerful system out there, so they can pull off some pretty big graphics accomplishments.\n",

I've tried the Windwaker a little, and it is also a great deal of fun.  No, there are not many games that involve running over people and stealing their cars, but from my point of view (and I'm neither a parent nor a small child) this is an advantage -- it means that instead of cheap thrills, genuine, quality gameplay has to be an objective.  (Of course, I'm sure there are games that mix the two, but I can't say I want to play them.)  Of course, not all games on any system are good, so you have to pick and choose for yourself the kind of thing you want.\n",

Even the more adult themed games such as Resident Evil or Wrestlemania or Eternal Darkness lack an important thing...a fun level.  The controls are sluggish.  The controller itself can be awkward at times.  You'll find yourself getting lost in the controls instead of the puzzle you're supposed to be playing.

This game is drenched in great graphics on every level, and the levels look like they were ripped straight out of the movies and put inside the game.  The sound is equally phenominal, one of the first videogames to feature 5.1 surround sound that totally envelopes you into it.  The music is the same style as the movies, the huge orchestral productions, and it is nothing less than fantastic.  The sound of the TIE fighters is even better than the movies!  Now if you know a lot about 5.1 sound, you may be thinking (What kind of a liar is this guy?  Gamecube doesn't have a digital output, so it can't do 5.1!)  Well, using a great new sound format called Pro Logic 2 from the same guys who brought you Dolby Digital, you can experience stunning 5.1 channel sound with just two RCA jacks.

The good parts about it are that the game is taking full advantage of the GameCube controller.  The analog stick controls your ship, the A button fires the laser, the B button drops or shoots bombs or some other secondary weapon, and the X and Y buttons are used to turn on your targeting computer (a cool feature- let's you clearly see the enemy) and switch from third-person to first person perspective.  Last but not least, we have the shoulder buttons, which will speed up or slow down your ship.  I really love the shoulder buttons in this game, press R to speed it up and click it down all the way to get a rumble and do full speed.  L will apply the brakes and it works the same way as R.  Controls are tight but not too tight, but I wish you could do moves like barrel rolls.\n",

       "Initially, I was really disappointed. I had never played any of the N64 games before, so I wasn't used to the controls. The TIE fighters blended in with the background too often. The radar was confusing. The missions were too hard -- TIEs would relentlessly pound me from behind, my tow cable would always snap while trying to down AT-ATs, I wouldn't understand the objectives of a mission sometimes.\n",
       "But I kept at it, and an hour or so later realized that this is the best Star Wars game ever made, and that this is probably the closest we'll get to flying in Luke and Wedge's cockpit for a long, long time. The visuals, of course, are spot on, and look like they were ripped straight out of the three movies. Movie fans are rewarded with cut scenes and dialogue that directly, eerily mirror the action of the movies, except that _you're_ the hero, and _you're_ the one to blame if the mission fails. The music is all very good, a blend of classic Star Wars and original Williamsesque tunes that work very well for the missions, adding further to the feeling of immersion within the Star Wars universe.\n",
       "The control -- it took me a while to get used to but now I can down TIEs with the greatest of ease. You learn to use your accelerator and decelerator to max effect. You learn to use the targeting computer to quickly highlight hard-to-see TIEs. And you learn the hard way which approaches work best on which types of enemies (hint: try to approach Star Destroyers from the side or the back rather than head-on). Yes, the missions are hard, and it can be frustrating. But the inescapable realization that you are _in_ the Star Wars universe, and the incredible fun will keep you pushing that \"Replay Mission\" button over and over again. And secrets: there are tons of secrets to reward the persistent gamer, including a rare opportunity to play a bit of the trilogy from the \"other\" perspective.\n",

Suddenly, what appeared to be 200+ TIEs came screaming at me from the rear, lasers blazing and swarming around the surprised fleet. I was literally overwhelmed with targets, all trying to independently evade and fire with nary a slowdown. As in RotJ, one of the pilots shouted, \"There's too many of them!\"\n",

However, if you are on the search for the best games ever made and ever to be made, the Nintendo Gamecube shines brightly as your choice.  Let me simplify that.  If you love games, get the Gamecube.  Mario, Zelda, Metroid, all of these beloved francises have been given amazing sequels, issuing a feeling that one can only describe as going \"back to the best times in gaming.\"  But don't think that Nintendo, the greatest game-maker in the world would rest on it's laurels.  Animal Crossing, Pikmin, and a host of other games have sprung from the minds over in Japan that keep the world guessing.

That's where the GameCube comes in.  While it has a couple of T and M games (rated for Teens or Mature, for you rookies out there), many of the games are safe E (rated for Everyone) time-wasters.  Games like Super Mario Sunshine, Super Smash Bros Melee and Pikmin are innocuous fun.  And the graphics compare favorably with all the other systems.

This led to people thinking it was a bad system, and even as far as to say it didn't belong in the class of the XBOX and PS2.  Well, people mis-judged, as this tiny little machine out-does in almost every category the PS2, and in some aspects, the XBOX.\n",
       "1. The system: The GC is easily better than the DC or the PS2 for these 3 simple reasons.  1) It's small, compact, and yet twice as powerful as either of the other 2.  This little cube has enough graphics power to dish out beautiful, splashing water, sharp fighting details, sweat dripping from athletes faces, and fiery eruptions that will make u put your hands over your eyes.  This thing can bring a convincing world to your screen, and is highly reccomended for anyone buying a game system for kids younger than 8, and even those of 8-14.  \"Why?\" is this not reccomended for adults.  It's not that it isn't a good system, or that it doesn't have good games.\n",
       "1) The games are aimed at kids, not adults.  Ok, sure, any Mario game or Donkey Kong adventure can entertain an adult for a few hours.  But it just looses interest, as the computer AI isn't very good, the riddles aren't very challenging, and the skill required to beat them isn't going to make you work very hard.  Most adults also don't like the controller (which I'll get to more detail in a minute), which is quite small and cramped in many areas for adults, and just looks a bit...odd for those hardcore HALO, GTA, or even all those great sports titles.  This system is aimed at kids.\n",
       "2) Capabilties: This system is great for setting up in the car for a long trip accross the country, or even state to state, but it doesn't do much else but play those kid games.  The memory units are extremely small compared to the massive XBOX hard disk and PS2 Memory Card, so you'll often find yourself buying more memory units then games.  That's NO fun!  This system also has no way to play DVD's, play music, and can't be cleaned or fixed when the drive brakes (the CD drive can't contain CD cleaners, and can't be replaced with a regular DVD tray like the PS2 and XBOX).  The size of CD's can also be a problem, as many adults can't even fit their finger through the little circle in the middle, or could loose them quite easily.  It hasn't been the case for me, but I have rather small hands (still only 16).\n",
       "2. Games: This system has a ton of great games...aimed at kids.  If your an adult looking for a little gore, smart, fast computer AI, or even the casual sports title to build a franchise through, the GC is NOT FOR U!  The major games are for the most part the Mario's, Zeldas, Donkey Kong's, Star Foxx, etc...all cartoons.  You won't find the HALO's, GTA's, SOCOM: Navy Seals, or even games like Splinter Cell (nor the controller to use them).  If u want ALL of your games to be Mario-like (nothing wrong with that), this system is ok.  But for the more hard-core gamer like me, an XBOX, or even a PS2, would be a better choice.\n",
       "3) Controller: For games like Pikmin, perfect.  Huge buttons, small joy sticks, springy trigger buttons.  It's perfect!  But for sport's games like those that I love, HALO, Splinter Cell, games like that, the controller is awful.  It just doesn't work.  Notice that SEGA pulled all of their 2k sports titles as no one with a CUBE bought them.  If u look at the top 10 selling GC titles, you won't find a shooter (except maybe Metroid Prime by Nintendo).  This system, or controller, just doesn't work for these games.  On the other hand; for games like Mario, Melee, Zelda, Pikmin, Animal Crossing, etc...it's the best EVER MADE! And if you've got lots of money to spend, and don't mind owning a system just for one type of game, then the GC will do just fine.  But for someone with a low budget and wanting a little bit of Sports, RPG, some Shooters, Stealth, and even Mario-like games (Blinx, Crash Bandicoot), the XBOX was for me (also a DVD play and CD player, GC doesn't support).\n",
       "4) Online Plan: None!  It has a 56K adapter and works on broadband, but nothing like XBOX Live or even the PS2's online network.  No headset, no stat tracking, no buddy list, and not a very big list of games.  No real plan, it just seems to be there.  If u want to be left behind without the online gameplay of the future, I guess the GC will do fine.  But I am a gamer who loves playing other games like me, keeping stat track, trash talking, and enjoying good competition besides my little sister or next door neighbor.  The GC didn't suppport that!  \"Why?\"  I don't know.\n",
       "Overall, the GC is great for kids, and good for the casual gamer.  But for someone who is A) Low on money and would like a DVD player too!, B) Wants a controller and system that works with shooters and Sports, and C) Want's a few M titles in his collection, the GC was NOT for me.  This system will satisfy those looking for a system for kids, a second system, or even a first if they have a great PC.  But I needed more, and the GC didn't have it!\n",

The game looks amazing; it truly marks a new era in video-game graphics for home consoles. Rogue Leader will be released simultaneously with Nintendo's GameCube consolein November, and it's a stunning showcase for the new systems powerful specs. As a sequel to Star Wars Rogue Squadron for the N64, Rouge Leader retains a lot of the same mission based gameplay where players win metals for each campain depending on their performence. As Luke Skywalker, players get to choose from a wide array of ledgendary spacecraft, including the X-wing, A-wing, and B-wing. The game starts with a bang, throwing you right into the Death star trenches in an updated rendition of the classic Star Wars arcade game. Dodging TIE Fighters and cannon fires as you approach the Death Stars vuonerble exhaust port, you'l hear Obi-Wan's internal voice instructing you to \"use the force!\" An other impressive level involves an epic battle against a star destroier as you and your wing mate buzz around the behemoth ship like tiny mosquitoes. The sheer scale of these levels is dazzling, especially when you consider the ammount of graphic detail on each ship model. The sence of vastness is punctuated by the number of crafts battling on screen at the same time; you can even make out small scuffles in the far distance as your wingmen fire off bright laser cannons in seperate dogfights. You can issue orders to your wingmate to carry out various commands with the press of a button. In terrain missions, ground forces can also be instructed to attack or to defend key strategic points. The only way to score a gold metal an anny of these missions is to use your support crew wisely. Your the alpha leader, afterall, and it's up to you to destroy Darth Vader's evil empire! Other Star Wars highlights are revisited, including the famous Imperial Walker hog-tying sceen on the ice planet Hoth that made Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire for the N64 an instant classic. Whether you're a Boba Fett helmet-wearing Star Wars freak that Star Wars Rouge Squadron 2: Rouge Leader will be the most amazing-looking game in living rooms this holiday season.

It's a tech demo disguised as a must-have launch title.\n",
       "I was fooled by the numerous positive reviews into thinking this might be a half-decent Star Wars game (remember X-Wing and TIE Fighter?  I do), but it reminds me of all the godawful on-rails shooters from the days of the 3DO.  I can just imagine some Nintendo exec beaming \"What we really need to launch with is an updated version of Rebel Assault, yes sir!\"\n",
       "The opening level of this game places you in the middle of the Death Star battle from episode IV.  Sadly, there is no discernable \"battle\" in this level.  Rather, one flies around blowing up inoffesnive grey towers that are shooting hundreds of pretty laser bolts at nothing in particular.  They must be lonely or something.\n",
       "Once you take out these towers of flashy pacifism, a bunch of defenseless TIE fighters appear on the scene and fly around randomly until you hunt them down and shoot them.  This phase captures all the fun of going after fruit flies in the kitchen on a Summer's afternoon.\n",
       "Finally, one is unceremoniously dumped into the Death Star trench.  You are forced to remain in the trench and fly forward, avoid lots of grey obstacles that are difficult to see until they are right on top of you (nondescript grey things is a running theme in this game alas).  After the game designer has decided you avoided enough obstacles, your so-called escorts are killed/driven away in a scripted event.  Now, you must avoid the fire of three TIE fighters on your tail.  Can you perhaps, turn around and take them on?  Nooo.....  Can you do much of anything except wait this one out? Nooo....  Then, the TIE fighters go away in boredom, and Darth Vader is now on your tail.  Lather, rinse, repeat the previous TIE fighter attack until Han Solo arbitrarily shows up (just like the movie, golly) and Darth Vader goes away.  Now you must patiently await the appearance of the unshielded thermal exhaust port and fire a proton torpedo.\n",
       "And what's your reward for this?  A bunch of frickin' canned footage from Star Wars of the Death Star exploding.  I thought we got past this whole FMV thing back in the days of 3DO.

       "The first, tedious level should be a warning.  Go an play it in the store and if you don't like...  stay  away.  A boring stage where you repeatedly shoot at towers on the surface of the Death Star to blow them up is following by a MIND NUMBINGLY boring stage that has you blowing up TIE fighters that do nothing but fly around randomly in formation,  never attacking you and the only thing that makes them difficult to hit is that you simply CANNOT SEE THEM AGAINST THE BACKGROUND of the Death Star.  You have to employ the Targetting Computer by holding down the poorly chosen X button and strain to fire.\n",
       "It is followed by a long and boring trench flight where the same problems rear their heads.  You can't see the catwalks due to an utter lack of contrast between them and the speeding trench.  The Exhaust Port is invisible unless you hold down the targetting computer...  and flying while holding down X and trying to shoot at the same time with the B button is not only akward,  it's not any fun either.\n",

When it comes to purchasing a system this season it can be difficult depending on the person you are buying for. Since I own the Playstation 2, Microsoft X-box and the Gamecube I believe I can make a non-judgemental review of the Gamecube. If you are purchasing for the age group 5-10 this system is perfect, you have the selection of Lugi Mansion, Mario Sunshine, Animal Crossing, Super Mario Melee, which appeal not only to younger kids but the adults can play too. For the age group of 13-up, you have Resident Evil series, Metroid Prime, Eternal Darkness, those are the only games so far that have a mature theme that will appeal to an older or mature teen group. Nintendo has been known to cater to a younger crowd and it is evident in the games available to the console but they are making small changes and making more mature games. Nintendo success has been in part to older gamers like myself who spent there childhood saving up to buy Metroid, Super Mario Bros, etc.. To make a long story short, if you want an abundance of children games, than the Playstation or PS2 offer more titles for children. The Xbox is targeted to an adult crowd and to be honest I have not seen alot of children games available. The Gamecube offer's quality games, 50-less price tag, but not many games period for either crowd. Unless you are a die hard Nintendo fan like myself, you are better off with PSOne or PS2 and their giant selection of children and adult games.

Then, think of how unhappy you'll be now that you cannot return it and have spent even more money on games and controllers, then have to send it in to get repaired. To prove that this is not an isolated incident, I went and bought another one to still be able to play the numerous games while we waited for it to come back from being repaired and the new one is beginning to have the same problems, it's not even a month old yet. The problem: (I suspect) is that the games are mini CD size and they are filled with too much information and are therefore to sensitive to anything. Yes, they're clean and the system is still to sensitive and cannot read the games. Unless you have a \"clean room\", don't buy.

I previously owned a PS2 and couldn't wait to get rid of it....what a piece of crap.  The games are awful and graphics look like a really bad VGA game (not even SVGA) on your computer.  The XBOX is an interesting gaming console, but other than HALO, none of the games really interested me.  They all seem too \"similar\".  The GameCube has a better variety of games, whether you're looking for kids games, first person shooters, adventure, driving games, sports, flight sims (Star Wars: Rogue Leader is a MUST buy).....GameCube has it all.  I've been playing video games since the late 1970's (yes, I owned Pong!) and the graphics on the GameCube appeared better to me.  There was less of a polygon effect to the shape of characters heads.  It could be that the GameCube is easier and more effective for Game Developers - hence the better results.  When I bought the PS2, I was disappointed because the graphics were not as good as my PC.  I'm willing to accept a slight decrease in graphics quality, in order to play games on my T.V.....but, I the sacrifice was too much with the PS2.  With the GameCube, the graphics quality is almost as good as my PC, in fact, the smoothness of the graphics might even be better than my GeForce2 Video Card (Gasp!).

This allows the Gamecube to make more cutscenes than possible on the N64, making noticable graphics differences, in games such as Sonic Adventure 2: Battle and James Bond 007 in Agent Under Fire. Also, Nintendo has completely revamped the controller to feel fantastic in your hands. Although some people dislike the unorthadox button pattern (I, for one, love it =)), the L & R buttons will slip easily in their hands. All the buttons on the N64 controller are on there, along with the return of the X and Y buttons (not seen since the Super NES). Overall the greatest system yet.\n",

Despite the recent intervention of X-box and before that with Playstation, Nintendo has risen to the challenge presented by Sony and Microsoft to prove that not everyone is interested in bigger, better, faster and uglier. Nintendo has formed a franchise, much the same way Disney has and is now part of our cultural language. The characters we know the stories we love and the game, though basic in design appeal to us because there's a history and quality there. The Nintendo Game Cube, the most recent addition to the Nintendo family of consoles, will amaze you. The Nintendo simply does more with less than the other two systems. If you're struggling to decide how to spend your hard earned money just rent the systems or go over to a friends how and see the difference between them. The conclusion I came to was that the Nintendo offers more for less. You'll be able to afford more games and have more fun with the games that are offered. If you're struggling with the fact that the Playstation plays DVDs, know this, it is not by any means a good DVD player, meaning it doesn't relay the quality nearly as well as other DVD players.

Since I was a small child I have been fascinated with toys and video games. One of the pioneers of video gaming has been Nintendo of America which has been producing high quality video games for over twenty years! I have owned every console of theirs from the beginning. Now, back in 1996, Nintendo put out a high-quality console named the Nintendo 64, which produced high-quality video gaming with quick load times, the problem, however, was the aging cartridge format, which was looked upon as too old for the gaming industry as compared to the then new Compact Disk video game systems put out by Sega and Sony. (Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation.) The other problem with Nintendo 64 was that cartidges were too expensive and game publishers went with cheaper disks for the systems by Sega and Sony, (I.E. SquareSoft's Final Fantasy series) so Nintendo soon lost the console wars to Sony. However, their handheld Gameboy system kept the company as the leader of the handheld market, and in 2001, Nintendo finally abandoned the cartridge format to a small, CD based system with faster loading times, and a newer comfortable controller that is by far the most comfortable controller on the market. Now, the Gamecube is still less than a year old, and the choices amoung gamers is still light at best. However, with must have titles such as Metroid Prime, Super Mario Sunshine, and the awesome, Resident Evil series, all exclusives to the Gamecube, Nintendo has finally learned the mistakes of the Nintendo 64 and has become a leader of the video game console industry, and if you're an owner of the amazing Gameboy Advanced as I am, there are several games that will allow players to connect your GBA to the Gamecube with the assistance of a small cable available in stores. Also, the best news is that Squaresoft, the publisher of the Final Fantasy series is coming back to Nintendo on both the Gameboy Advanced and the Gamecube, which means that Sony's lock on video game rights is slowing disappearing!

       "Reasons for Cube dominance:\n",
       "-Graphics- just as good as xbox and ps2, maybe better.  the system is built on a gaming graphics and video card (strictly for cube) not a cpu graphic and video card.  This makes the games much more enhanced because of its focus only on game systems.\n",
       "-Sounds- the sounds in the game are excellent.  everyone raves about the xbox's sound, but having played both, i would say they sound the same.  the gamecube great sound tracks and sound effects.\n",
       "-Quality- if one thing that nintendo does best, it is making the games with quality instead of making a whole lot of games.  while the ps2 already has its great games made but also a lot of bad ones, and the xbox throwing up games out the ying yang (they strike a good game every once in a blue moon, with exception on halo), the nintendo takes its time and always pleases its followers when a game comes out. the nintendo makes more better games with less games even made.  if nintendo feels it needs to improve then it will delay the game until satisfied.\n",
       "-Sega- my personal favorite game company of all time has chosen to release most of its games to nintendo while give the xbox and ps2 only a few.  sega is the best game compan ever, and they are taking there little blue friend to the cube.\n",
       "-great series- bond, zelda, mario, donkey kong, and now resident evil and sonic, this alone blows away all other systems.\n",
       "-Eternal Darkness- this game will be probably the greatest game for the next few years.  This game was ready to be released for the N64 along time ago, about 5 years ago, but they wanted to make it the best it could possibly be and have been making it better since then.  expect a great game and maybe a great series.\n",
       "-Resident Evil Series- All the original games remade to be better on the cube.  need i say more?\n",
       "-size- small, compact, sleek, perfect.  probably the best sized vdeo game i can remember even better than the genesis. can easly travel with, can buy a nice tv to hook on the back of it.\n",
       "-Controler- almost completely perfect, as if they molded someones hand the right size.  easy to learn, and easy to use. (sega dreamcast has the best)\n",
       "-Devoted- strictly a video game system, not a pc in a box.\n",
       "-speed- faster than the box with most games and doesnt have a computer lag like the xbox.\n",

The first thing you'll probably say when you see this system is, \"I didn't know it was that small!\"  But please, don't pass this one by because of it's size.  This system is incredible, and the black color looks great.  Sure, it may not be the most powerful or have the most games (yet), but it sure is fun!\n",
       "I've had my GameCube since the day it came out, and I still play it nearly every day, if I get the chance.  The system is just so fun, and you would never think that cute little thing on the ground in front of your television would be capable of creating such a great time.\n",
       "I'll start with the controller.  This controller is the best ever.  It fits nearly perfect in any size hands, and it causes no pain at all to fingers (unless you have arthritis I guess) or hands.  There is now an enlarged \"A\" button for games where a single button is used often.  The \"L\" and \"R\" shoulder buttons now fit perfectly with your index fingers.  There is now a \"C-stick\" instead of the previous \"C\" buttons on the N64 controller.  It moves very smoothly.  There are easily accessible \"X\" and \"Y\" buttons on top of the \"A\" button.  The \"Z\" button has been moved beside the right trigger, and that is probably the single worst part about this controller.  Overall, the controller is excellent, with only one major flaw (the \"Z\" button).\n",
       "Next, the memory card.  This memory card is alright, but it doesn't really compare to its counterparts.  The XBOX has a hard drive, and the PS2 has a much larger card.  The standard Nintendo-brand memory card carries 59 blocks (hence the name Memory Card 59).  The average GameCube game can use from three to fifteen blocks, but some of the seasons on sports games can be pretty high, with blocks over the limit of the card.  This card definitely needs some improvement, but Nintendo is coming out with the Memory Card 251, with an improved archive of two hundred and fifty one blocks.\n",
       "Now, for what I consider the most important part of a system: the games.  I consider Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II to be the best game for this system at the time.  It combines the classic Star Wars movies with a whole new experience for a ton of fun.  Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is the next best game in my opinion for this system.  Whoever has played the Tony Hawk series in the past must have this game, and whoever has never played this one has to play it.  It is a skateboarding game, but not just any skateboarding game.  It is fun for all players, whether you like skateboarding or not.  The whole Resident Evil series has been and is currently in the process of being remade for the GameCube.  The original Resident Evil is already out, and I rank it the third best game for this system.  Many people have bought a GameCube simply for this game.  It has the best graphics EVER for any system I believe.  These are just three of MANY other great games for this system.  Other greats include Fifa 2002, Pikmin, Super Smash Bros. Melee, NBA Street, SSX Tricky, Super Monkey Ball, and Sega Soccer Slam.  There are many more great games for you to choose from, other than the ones I mentioned.\n",
       "Now, for all you techies like me, I'll give some specs for the system.  You don't have to read this part if you're bored already.  The GameCube uses a Custom IBM Power PC processor (Gekko).  The clock frequency is 485 MHz, and the pixel depth is 24-bit.  The System LSI is a Custom ATI (\"Flipper\"), and all the sound related functions are incorporated into it.  The real-world polygons (assuming everything is already textured, lit, etc.) are 6-12 million polygons per second.  The media that is used by the GameCube is a 3-inch mini disk that holds approximately 1.5 Gigabytes of data.  There are four controller ports, two memory card slots, two high-speed serial ports, one parallel high-speed port, one analog AV output port, and one digital AV output port.\n",
       "The Nintendo GameCube is an excellent system for all ages.  I would recommend it for anyone who is looking forward to having a good time with any kind of video games.  Whether you've been playing video games all your life, or you are completely new to them, the GameCube is a great system to have.  Nintendo's next-generation system has just received a \"Mission Accomplished\" in my book.  I hope this review could sway a few opinions about the system.  And no, I am not an XBOX or a PS2 basher.  I love both of those systems too.  Thanks for reading this review.\n",

Despite continuing hype and alleged superiority of Playstation (1 and 2) and X-box (not to mention the various Sega systems in the past), Nintendo continues to outshine the competition.  Beginning with Super NES in the early 90's, Nintendo matched competing game systems in graphics capability and exceeded them when it came to quality of game titles.  GameCube is just the latest in that long line Nintendo products that takes all comers and disposes of them with frightening ease.  The key to Nintendo's continued success is the lessons learned from its first-generation platform, the Nintendo Entertainment System.  While there were a number of excellent titles for the system, there was no quality control on who could make games for the system or what was required for the games to be allowed on the system.  As a result, there were a large number of horribly inferior titles made by 3rd-party software companies.  These games were confusing, difficult to play, and ultimately very unsatisfying.  Nintendo cracked down on this and established very specific rules and guidelines to be followed for titles made for their subsequent systems.  As a result, the number of inferior titles shrunk to almost nil (some are always going to get through, it's just a fact of the business).  Already, GameCube has a set of games (released at launch or with the Christmas rush) that have all met critical and consumer success.  While the number of titles currently available are less in number than Playstation 2 (which admittedly has a year head start) and X-Box, they are of higher quality.  Playstation is still trying learn about quality control of game titles.  PS 2's selection is better than some of awful games that made it to PS 1, but it still has a long way to go.  X-Box simply comes across as a system that just wanted to rush out as many games as possible in time for launch, without really considering their quality.  Witness X-box's less than stellar sales record and critical and consumer drubbing of most of its titles.  GameCube's graphics are equal (if not superior) to the graphics of the competing systems.  While the Cube may not have some of the bells and whistle's trappings of a DVD player like the other systems, it's not held back by that.  With DVD player prices dropping like rocks, a person can get a decent one [inexpensively] these days.  No reason to pay [a lot more] for a game system that has that capability.  For pure gaming pleasure, GameCube is the king.  I continue to look forward to the new titles Nintendo will release (I'm sooooooo looking forward the Metroid sequel) while enjoying those games which are currently in release.

       "\n",
       "1. It's not faster than Xbox and it's not slower than PS2. It's something in between.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. It's compact size is definatelly a plus if you don't have space in your house or decide to travel with GC alot. I don't see how a bigger size makes a system so much worse. I put my system in one place, and move it once a month at most.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Games are more \"childish\" for a GC, however, it doesn't mean -bad games. Nintendo has always been known for cutting down violence in the games (Mortal Kombat etc.)  Most GC games are rated from \"Everyone(6+)\" to \"Teen (13+)\" with a few exceptions.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. You can't help but to notice how well Nintendo games are made though. Quality games is what Nintendo is about. It's very rare that there are \"bugs\" in games, especially first party games.\n",

       "6. Attention has been brought to Nintendo's small dvd disks. Are those better or worse? Well, if taking consumer side, they are worse. Even though some like GC's original disc size, it still is a downside. Since GC games use pretty much the same DVD cases as Xbox and PS2, the advatnage of the game taking less space is lost right away. Just like with N64, Nintendo again tries to stop \"game piracy\". The ending result? almost 2 times smaller DVD that is probably well protected (atleast for now), that contains 3 times less information. If PS2 And Xbox DVDs are appx. 4.5 gigabytes, Gamecube contains appx 1.5 gigabytes of space. Will Nintendo have a problem with lack of DVD space? Probably. The game \"SSX Tricky\" that was ported from PS2 to Xbox and GC doesn't contain additional DVD content on Gamecube due to the lack of space.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Gamecube doesn't have HDD disc and its modem only will support 56K Dialup (Atleast that's the info we know today). Xbox and PS2 will support DSL and 56K dialup once online networks are operational.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. Unlike PS2 and Xbox, Gamecube doesn't support DVD movies or CDs playback. Even though some say that they already have DVD player and stereo system and they are just looking for a \"gaming machine\". But how many kids actually have their own DVD player in the room?\n",
       "\n",
       "9. Well, it all comes down to price. Currently, Gamecube is appx. 25% cheaper than PS2 or Xbox. And on average GC accessories cost less than PS2's or Xbox's.\n",
       "\n",
       "10. And games... PS2 still probably has the best games on the market, not to mention alot more of them. Yet the system is getting old, and it often starts to lose the battle of \"Best graphics\" to GC or Xbox.\n",
       "It's hard to predict where Xbox is going though, some think it will be \"an entertainment center\" soon, others send it straight to \"Dumpsville\". Even though Xbox has great hardware, it does very little to save the system so far. Microsoft losing money on each system, and overall system sells relatively poorly.\n",

       "To my opinion, its advantages might be:\n",
       "1- Has exclusivity on some demanded franchises like Rogue Squadron II, Resident Evil.\n",
       "2- And probably the most important advantage is having a lot of titles that are dedicated for effortless fun, that requires only quick reflexes, which doesn't frustrate gamers by getting them stuck or lost at some point.\n",
       "I believe the second advantage is more important that the first, since no one likes to play a game were his objective turns out to be searching for gameplay rather than enjoying the gameplay.\n",

Gamecube has the second highest sales for game systems.  While it and Xbox significantly trail PS2, Gamecube is ahead of Xbox.  However, it will be interesting to see how all three of them fair now that their prices have dropped significantly....  Gamecube utilizes an IBM developed 450 MHz (approx.) processor and an onboard ATI graphics chip.  Gamecube games are on miniature DVD's, they are about half the size of regular ones.  Although many of the games are designed for all ages, some people think the only good games are games which contain the greatest ratio of violence to game play.  However, don't forget that Nintendo's main success is its Characters, namely Mario, Luigi, Link, Donkey Kong and Kirby all of which are characters for all ages.  Even Metroid and Megaman are relatively harmless for children.  Nintendo has been criticized for the lack of mature themed games in the past; however, they have recently acquired the Resident Evil franchise that was, but is no longer, exclusively licensed to Sony (Playstation games).  Nintendo also has Perfect Dark and a new Bond game (uncharacteristically violent franchises for Nintendo).  The N64 was financially very successful for Nintendo and thus, led them to develop the Gamecube.  It is not well known, but even though the Gamecube has comparable graphics to other 128 bit systems, it is still only a \"64 bit\" system.  However, it is \"64 true bits\" and uses one SINGLE 64 bit chip.  The N64, unlike the Gamecube, utilizes TWO SEPARATE 32 bit chips, that when added up equals 64 bits.  Because it is not \"64 true bit,\" the graphics N64 are no match for those of the Gamecube.  It also may interest you to know that most computers aren't even 64 bit, but like the Gamecube, they are also \"true bit\" systems, which is why they look so good.  The Gamecube is also cheaper than the other two systems out. ....  The Gamecube's (and Nintendo's for that matter) success has been rooted in the universality of their games.  Nintendo has always held a strong foothold in the video game industry.  Their game systems don't need perks, gimmicks, incentives or even *DVD* players for people to buy them.  They sell of their own dedication to be a \"true\" video game system for both serious and novice gamers alike.  Nintendo will continue to survive as a formidable player that any serious game maker will have to acknowledge if they wish to be successful in the ever expanding market of video games.\n",

       "Here is my layout of the 3 systems organized by categories:\n",
       "Graphics: PS2 - Excellent Graphics, just lagging a bit behind GC and XBOX.  XBOX - Best Graphics of all 3, undoubtedly.\n",
       "GameCube - In Between, the titles make up for the lack of superior graphics.\n",
       "Controller: PS2 - Most preferred controller, Dual analog sticks, D-Pad and shapes aswell (Circle, Square, X, etc).  XBOX - Eww don't make me vomit: HUGE, Bulky, meant for a three-handed person with it's over-sized joysticks that are too hard to reach.\n",
       "GameCube - Middle of the 3 again.  The GC controller was designed for a slighty smaller hand, and there are reports floating around that the buttons may stick after extensive use.  Also the cables are a bit short, but boo hoo!\n",
       "CPU: PS2 - Coming in last one this one, the computer technology is just moving way too fast.  A lot of people may be foolish and think \"oh wow the Xbox is 700mhz and the Gamecube is only 485mhz.\" Well look a bit deeper, and you will find Gamecube is running a PowerPC chip, a RISC processor, which, at similar clock speeds, is SUPERIOR to the aluminum SISC processor in the XBox. In reality, the Cube's CPU can compete with a 650-733mhz SISC processor. GameCube wins obviously in this report.\n",
       "Games:  OF COURSE the Most Important part of the console, but nobody really looks into this aspect as much as hardware, etc.  PS2 - Right Now, they have the best games SIMPLY BECAUSE it has been out for about a year and a half!  XBOX - Their games have potential, but it's MICROSOFT, they over all make really lousy games!  Their developers ran at the first sign of trouble.  GameCube - Now they have got the Licenses and the Devs for the best out of all 3.  They have an EXCELLENT 2002/2003 lineup, including Metroid (FINALLY!) StarFox, Zelda (WOOHOO), Star Wars: The Clone Wars and many other titles, and they have some classics already released such as Super Smash Bros. Melee!\n",
       "OVERALL the PS2 is the winner at this point in time, but give the GameCube till 2003 before you make your hasty decisions.  The XBOX is going no-where, they are losing about $[money] per system (I DONT CARE IF THEY ARE MICROSOFT, NO COMPANY CAN TAKE LOSSES THAT BAD!!) They are relying PURELY on Games, yet they have NO GOOD DEVELOPERS LEFT!!  Nintendo and Sony have all the good licenses, nobody likes Microsoft!

The graphics are amazing especially in Bloody Roar: Primal Furyn a gamecube exclusive. When I first saw this game my mouth dropped open. The people looked amazingly real.\n",
       "2. Sound - The sound is incredibly crisp and clear. Especially that it supports Dolby surround and Dolby 5.1. I have Agent Under Fire and the sound of the guns and the explosions sounded very realistic. The sound and voices on Simpson's Road Rage were hilarious and were accurate to the show.\n",
       "3. Games - Nintendo has been known for making awesome games and they have never let us down yet. Especially with the games coming out for Gamecube: Zelda, Mario Sunshine, Metroid Prime, Star Fox and recently Final Fantasy which is way awesome. The games are incredibly fun and the graphics are amazing. On Xbox the graphics are the only thing that seems to be important not the fun factor.\n",

Coming in at the cheapest of the 3 consoles out, the GameCube is surely the best for your money. As i have said, the amount of games set to be released for the GameCube is amazing. With well known characters such as Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong and Peach, Nintendo have alot to choose from when it comes to picking characters for a game.

Started by the Sega Saturn, then the 'Playstation' and the Nintendo 64 gamers were taken into a 3 dimensional world of gaming never before seen. Each company had their own marketing ideas The Sega Saturn was churned out way to quickly, the 'Playstation' attained its market through vast variety of games, often opting for quantity, not quality and the N64 decided to target a wide market and were often labeled 'Too Childish'\n",
       "So now it's past the millenium Sega are all but gone, deciding to produce games for Nintendo as well as focus on their arcade market. The big three are now Sony with their Playstation 2 console, Microsoft has entered the market with the X-box and Nintendo has released the 'Gamecube' the greatest and prettiest console ever. But what makes the 'Gamecube' so great?\n",
       "First of all it's due to the fact Nintendo has decided to make a Video game machine. It's nice, the PS2 and X-box have opted for big multimedia machines. The result? The PS2 has issues with half the DVD's on the market and the X-box is very expensive and is the size of a VCR. Nintendo have truly created a wonderful machine, look at the price, very inexpensive, fabulous games and due to the Sega- Nintendo team up maybe the dream of a Sonic the hedgehog- Mario game can be recognized.\n",
       "In this day and age there is too much obsession over 'How childish a system is' the 'Gamecube' balances this perfectly. There is everything from 'Luigi's Mansion' to 'Resident Evil 0' plus I think there is way too much of this 'childish' obsession. Lest we forget the three biggest video game characters of all time were Mario, Sonic and Crash Bandicoot. All non-violent games.\n",
       "Games on the `Cube' are amazing. Crazi Taxi, Luigi's Haunted mansion, Rogue Leader, Wave Race Cube, Wrestlemania X-8, and later Perfect Dark 2, and the much awaited `Eternal Darkness: Sanity's requiem'- which is described as the most sadistic game ever made. The `Gamecube' offers the best games of both the Nintendo and Sega grooves. As always Nintendo will always opt for the quality, not quantity with their games. Ensuring even the bottom of the rack will compare to the mid level games on other systems.\n",
       "The 'Gamecube' is also one of the most powerful machines on the market. It beats the PS2 in every aspect and whilst the X-box is more powerful it lacks the killer game base and low price the 'gamecube' has. With the 'Gekko' processor in the 'Gamecube' (designed by IBM) the visuals of this system is amazing. Also revolutionary is the game discs... likened to mini DVD's, the 8 inch discs have the capabilities of holding 1.5 gigabytes.\n",
       "Aesthetically the `Gamecube' is amazing. By far the best looking system, stylish, compact, discreet and powerful the Nintendo `Gamecube' is the system for people who want a game console. No a game console/DVD player/ PC Internet, multimedia machine. I mean when it comes down to it people buy these machines for the games and by keeping the formula simple Nintendo will continue being the greatest game company ever.</td><td>A34CVPZ30BA4GD</td><td>James Robert Dator</td><td>null</td><td>The best console ever made.</td><td>1019865600</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B000MXIN22</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>These pants appear to be well made of substantial fabric.

There are so much hostility towards this system, and almost all of it is from people who complain about the \"lack of games\" or the fact that it is a \"kid's system\". These are people who probably never played a Gamecube in their life.\n",
       "This is an excellent system, and I will list the reasons why:\n",
       "1. Price. I have a DVD player, and most video game console DVD players are mediocre at best (the PS2 one is really bad). This system is very affordable, at under [money], and great value.\n",
       "2. Games. Though there are not too many now, just wait. Every Nintendo system had a slow start, most went on to greatness (even the N64, which I like). While the Xbox and PS2 systems have over 200, only a few of them are actually good. Quality over Quantity.\n",
       "3. The controller. A lot of people don't like the gamecube controller, but I think it is the best one available. It is easy to move, easy to understand, and easy to grasp the first time playing. The Xbox controller is the size of a Whopper and just as difficult to play with. The PS2 is basically the PS1 controller, but it feels cheaper.\n",
       "4. Popular Nintendo titles. You can never get enough Mario, Zelda, Starfox, and Donkey Kong. All of the popular Nintendo characters will get the 128-bit treatment. And with Metroid, Mario Kart, others on their way, you cannot say that there will be no good games.\n",
       "5. Squaresoft. It ha recently been revealed that the bad blood between Squaresoft, makes of the Final Fantasy series and other fantastic RPGs, and Nintendo is over. There will be Squaresoft games in the future of Gamecube, as well as Gameboy Advance. Perhaps the lack of RPGs is partly responsible for the failure of the N64.\n",
       "5. The fact that the games on Xbox and Gamecube look exactly the same. I have played games for both systems, and have noticed no difference in terms of graphics and sound. In terms of gameplay, Gamecube is much better. Games I have tried on both are Tony Hawk, 007 Agent Under Fire and some snowboarding game I forgot the title.\n",
       "6. Size. While the Xbox is bigger than my VCR, and the PS2's construction leaves something to be desired, the Gamecube is attractive, small, compact, solidly constructed, and easy to install. The game discs themselves are very small, but can hold just as much data as full size CDs.\n",
       "7. Not just a Kid's system. I am 22 years old, and I find that the Gamecube games are just as good for adults as they ae for kids. Simple reason: They are fun. If all you look for in a game is blood, gore, breakneck action, or the ability to shoot everything in sight, than perhaps the gamecube is not for you. But if you like fun games that keep you involved, the Gamecube is the best. I don't have time these days for long RPGs or super-long shooters. At the end of the day, I got for Mario and Donkey Kong.\n",
       "But having said all of this, there are a few flaws. These small game discs are easily scratched, meaning that a little damage can go a long way. As well, I am a bit annoyed with the fact that they have pushed back Starfox and Zelda, AGAIN. But good things come to those that wait, so I can wait. Overall, the positives outweigh the negatives on the Gamecube. If you wish to be snotty and keep slagging off the Gamecube, fine, it just leaves more fun for the rest of us.</td><td>A2YAABMT80RLYA</td><td>Ben Rowland</td><td>null</td><td>Quality over quantity</td><td>1019606400</td><td>false</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>B000MXIN22</td><td>null</td><td>1.0</td><td>These frayed out at the bottom and were not to long that they were walked on and one of the two pairs ripped out between the legs within the first two months.</td><td>A2DVZJN5A4WRHB</td><td>bldawson</td><td>{\"Size:\":\" 38W x 29L\",\"Color:\":\" Khaki\"}</td><td>Poor quality</td><td>1396569600</td><td>true</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>B00005QEFD</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>After Nintendo's enormous failure (at least globally) with the horrible N64, they decided to get rid of the outdated cartridge format and use a CD-based format. The result is the Gamecube, a system with enormous potential to be one of the best console systems in existence. However, with everything the system has, is it enough to overcome the dominating grasp of Sony's PS2, the sky-high hype of Microsoft's Xbox, and the unfair prejudices that plague it?\n",
       "First of all, the Gamecube is from Nintendo, the Big-N, so players know they are getting one thing: quality. Nintendo has never let down its rabid fanbase when it comes to the quality of its popular franchises. Even with the N64, Nintendo proves it could still make fantastic games with Mario, Link, Star Fox, and even new franchises that were just as successful. And because these franchises will never see the light of day on other consoles, it's a pretty safe bet for Nintendo fans to choose the Gamecube.\n",
       "Another pro (at least for some people) the Gamecube has is Nintendo's policy with it: a focus on games. Unlike the PS2 or the Xbox, the Gamecube has no DVD player, no CD player, and can only play specially-formatted game discs. Because of this, I really admire Nintendo because it shows how dedicated they are towards the gaming experience. DVDs and CDs are meant to be played in their respective players, not in a gaming console. And the Gamecube is probably the smallest modern console ever created, making it extremely easy to carry from place to place.\n",
       "However, Nintendo's newest console has suffered a serious backlash lately. The biggest backlash is the claim that the Gamecube is a kids' system, not meant for the more mature gamer that the Xbox and PS2 are trying to capture. Even with titles like \"Eternal Darkness\" and the remake of \"Resident Evil\" coming to the Gamecube, many players still see the Big-N's console as a kids' console. This bias is extremely unfair, as most of Nintendo's franchises have been appreciated by gamers of all ages. Unfortunately, with games like \"Super Monkey Ball\", this prejudice will be hard to overcome.\n",
       "Several other cons lie in the Gamecube's design. The biggest design flaw is its controller. While by no means terrible, the Gamecube controller feels very awkward and can make a gamer feel like he's doing nothing but button-mashing. The fact that the right shoulder of the controller has two buttons and the left only has one makes the Gamecube controller questionable at best. Another design flaw is based upon Nintendo's policy towards online gaming. The Big-N believes that online gaming has little or no place in the console market, but the PS2 and Xbox sales are based partially upon this concept. While the future of online gaming on consoles is questionable, the fact that Nintendo doesn't plan to head in that direction anytime soon is hurting its reputation with some gamers.\n",
       "As of now, the future of the Gamecube is uncertain. While it is second in sales globally, it is third in sales within the States. While Nintendo is known for its quality games, it's also known for its delays, and it has kept up that reputation with delays of some of its bigger franchises like \"Star Fox\". The one thing that could've saved the Gamecube at launch, a Mario title, never came (we were stuck with the Gamecube tech-demo known as the average \"Luigi's Mansion\"), so serious gamers these days are questioning the fate of the Gamecube and whether it will live up to its promise. If Nintendo can deliver its killer franchises, then the Gamecube's future is secure, but if it doesn't act fast enough, then it will be severely overshadowed by the PS2 and the Xbox.</td><td>A1AR8HYZ17T5H7</td><td>Arxane</td><td>null</td><td>A Nintendo system with potential, but is it enough?</td><td>1019347200</td><td>false</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>B000MXIN22</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Great fit,great price.

It's a freaking d-pad built underneath a cheap imitation analog stick -_-. So yeah you pretty much have two d-pads (well three...they use another one for the c-stick). This makes subtle movements very difficult to execute (sneaking in Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes for example). Who the hell wants to use a (yeah \"a\" not \"the\" -_-) d-pad to play a 3D action game? Jackasses that's who. The buttons are fine, except the z-button which will probably crap out after 100 presses. At the very least I can say that it holds up ok for games without a z-axis, even fast paced action games like Brawl or Muramasa. This was the first (and last) time I bought a controller like this (you know the sweat shop kind) and I didn't really know what to expect. I thought that maybe it would be made of an inexpensive material, maybe some cheap buttons, and it would be a lot less durable (all true btw). But having no analog stick? I mean it's not even a real controller anymore >.>. Bottom line, do not purchase this product. Obviously it's cheaply made, obviously it's not an official Nintendo product, but what isn't obvious is that it lacks a basic controller function necessary for most 3D action games x.x.

It possesses a unique design that allows the user to developing an intuitive sense of where each button or control is and what it does, as opposed to Playstation's perfectly symmetrical controller that requires the user to consciously think about which buttons they are pressing.  The advantage to the more intuitive design is that it frees the user to focus more attention on the action taking place on the screen and, given the advanced nature of today's games, that is a very important benefit to have.  The asymmetrical way in which the buttons are placed throughout the pad help the user develop a customized feel for the pad based on the different spacings.  Additionally, the buttons, themselves, are shaped different (the X and Y buttons are kidney-shaped and the A and B buttons are different-sized round buttons), which enhances the intuitive feel of control.

       "  Many people say this controller was made for people with small hands. I disagree with that. I have small hands myself, but I have a few friends who have huge hands, and they have no problems with it. The left and right triggers are in the perfect position for both of your index fingers. All the buttons on the right side of the controller are easily accessible with your right thumb. They button layout is nearly perfect; with an enlarged \"A\" button for games with repetitive pressing of a single button. The analog stick can be easily accessed with your left thumb, and it rotates smoothly every time. The C-stick has replaced the C buttons from the previous N64 controller, and it allows for much more precise control.\n",
       "  The only problems I could possibly think of with this controller are that the control pad is a bit small, but it is very rarely used, so that really isn't too big of a problem and the second thing I could think of was that the length of the controller cable is a bit short, but that can be easily fixed with extension cables. And now that the WaveBird is out, you can enjoy the wonderful GameCube controller without all the trouble of cables!\n",
       "  I've had this controller for nearly eight months now, and it is still extremely dependable. All the buttons are still firm, and the control stick is still nice and tight. Nintendo hardly needs to issue any kind of a warrantee with this controller; there is hardly any chance of anything bad happening to it.  You would have to drop something heavy on it, or pour something on it.  I've dropped my controller numerous times, and nothing has happened to it yet.  It is still in nearly brand new factory specifications. I am truly amazed.\n",

I suggest the Pellican G-3 or Madcatz controllers because they are slightly larger and allows your hands to relax while holding it. After switching to the G-3 I've had no problems and complete comfort. I plan on getting a Madcatz one as well because you need up to 4 controllers anyway and I like the grip on them. I only suggest you buy these VERY SMALL Nintendo brand controllers if you're buying for a child. I normally NEVER EVER buy 3rd party controllers or accessories either but with this I had no choice. I would like to mention though the EXCELLENT button shape and placement. This is the first controller I've been able to hit the right button consistently on demand with. Even the L and R buttons that are usually awkward to reach and use while using the regular A, B, X, and Y buttons simultaneously. The Z button takes a little getting used to though.

       "5. The new analog joystick is much stronger and more precise than the previous one on N64. It also has a rubber top to provide excellent grip.\n",

       "7. The built-in-rumble feature makes the controller jump to life while you play (Nintendo invented this aspect with the first rumble-packs for N64).\n",
       "If you have played games on all the systems and tried out all the controllers (like i have), then you will agree that this is the best controller by far. Not only does it melt in your hands (sometimes you will literally forget it is there), but it also features a new intuitive button layout which makes controlling games much easier. The PS2 and Xbox controllers are more confusing with buttons that are all exactly the same shape. Also the buttons on the Xbox controller are too close to each other, and the analog can even get in the way while playing! It seems like whoever designed the Xbox controller basically copied the Dreamcast controller but somehow made it worse (one word - pathetic). So far i haven't experienced anything bad with the GameCube controller, i don't even mind the smaller d-pad. I think i was actually pulling off moves faster in Tony Hawk 3 with the smaller d-pad!! I also find that the PS2 d-pad gives me blisters, especially with fighting games (games with alot of movement). This is because it is broken up in four and not connected (in one solid + shape). To sum it up- Nintendo obviously takes alot more care when they design a controller, and they've been doing it for longer than either Sony or Microsoft. The new GameCube controller reflects an evolution of the previous Nintendo controllers. It really seems like Nintendo tries to innovate with every new controller, and this one is the best yet.

Nintendo's goal was to make the controller so that you don't even recgonize that you are using it.  They got it right.  The oversized A button is perfectly placed, as is the X, Y, L, R, and Start/Pause buttons.  The C stick and Digital control pad are placed well for small as well as larger hands, but it still could be a little bigger for the largest of hands.

Having purchased the import Gamecube with Luigi Mansion and WaveRace I thought I was in for gaming heaven but found myself bored within minutes. Luigi Mansion can best be described as a children's version of Resident Evil where our hero Luigi (sporting a vacuum cleaner) must unlock the secrets of the mansion to rescue his brother Mario.\n",
       "Graphically I was again under whelmed. The simple low polygon worlds looked like they could be done on PS2 only better. In fact recently I had the chance to Play PS2's Okage and was amazed to discover that the graphic style in that game is very similar and looks a lot better. The rendering was also not so great and I was surprised to discover pixelation in mirror reflections (which, by the way, looked completely phony) and on a projection screen in one of the rooms. The special effects and lighting in Luigi's Mansion were the only graphically solid aspect of the game, but even they failed to impress me beyond what I'd expected.\n",
       "WaveRace was also disappointing, but maybe that's because I had my hopes too high after all the high praise the game has gotten from Nintendo \"fan sites\". The game is a racing game on water and plays like one. The water effects while good failed to impress me as much as I thought they would and wound up looking flat and lifeless. The reflections in the water also seemed unnatural and looked like the reflections of a mirror instead of water. The game throws some varied whether conditions at you which in turn affects the waves and makes turning a lot harder. This succeeds in giving each race a sense of unpredictability. In the end the whether effects are the only things that keep the game fresh, as the courses are standard fair and rather mundane.\n",
       "WaveRace's graphics outside the realm of waves and water are again disappointing and are nothing that can't be done on PS2. In fact two upcoming PS2 games similar in theme (Wave Rally and Splashdown) look like they will surpass WaveRace in every category. This is not what I expect from a next generation system; one that's supposedly more powerful then the current market leader PS2.\n",
       "The system in general is small but oddly shaped sporting a \"handle\" on the back. Clearly Nintendo is catering to children's tastes with the design of the system as opposed to adult home theater tastes like the design Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PS2. The system is also top loading and because of its height it may be difficult to find adequate shelf space. Games come on mini-discs and as Nintendo puts it \"can fit in the palm of a child's hand\". Nintendo seems to once again want to go in the opposite direction of its competitors (Microsoft and Sony) who both use standard DVDs. When Nintendo opted to go with cartridges for its Nintendo 64 console instead of CDs it backfired dramatically. I fear Nintendo choosing Mini-discs over standard DVDs will have a similar effect.\n",
       "Although the controller looks odd and small I found it remarkably comfortable which was definitely a pleasant surprise. Not once did I find the feel or button placement lacking or awkward. The Gamecube controller is definitely a big step up from the Nintendo 64 one and should accommodate the needs of both children and adults.\n",
       "\n",
       "Unfortunately Nintendo's new system unlike the Xbox and PS2 will not be able to play DVDs EVER unless you purchase a separate system from Panasonic. The fact you can't play DVD movies on Gamecube is going to factor into a consumer's decision to purchase a Gamecube or not.\n",
       "In the end this is an awful start to what could be a good system. Unfortunately the future doesn't look too bright since Gamecube games are sparse thanks to Nintendo's handling of third parties and its target demographic. Gaming consoles are continually moving towards the older gamer, but Nintendo traditionally goes after the under 13 demographic and if what I've seen so far is any indication they will continue to do so in the future.\n",
       "With one or two exceptions the games Nintendo has on the horizon are simply not enticing. Additionally Nintendo's recent handling of their major franchises (like changing Zelda's graphics to Cel Shading and making them decidedly cartoonish) has created unrest among even diehard Nintendo fans. Out of the three major consoles (PS2, Xbox and Gamecube) Nintendo's new console seems to have the least support from third parties and major franchises like Metal Gear Solid, Silent Hill 2, and Final Fantasy are absent.\n",
       "It looks as if Nintendo is doomed to make the same mistakes they made with N64. If you want my advice stare clear of Nintendo's Gamecube for at least a year to judge where the system is going. There certainly aren't any games available at launch that are worthwhile. Nintendo's decision to launch Gamecube without a Mario game will be one that comes back to haunt them this November.\n",
       "A PS2 with its established library of games or Microsoft's graphically stunning Xbox are the best and most desirable gifts this holiday season. Consumers should take a wait and see approach to Gamecube.\n",

Also, without the patches, you will find that you cannot use your diplomatic strategies to their full extent.\n",

At first glance, one may be tempted to take a purely military approach and carve out a massive empire for yourself.  However, you may then find yourself teetering on bankruptcy and facing continual revolts throughout your domain.  You may also find the rest of the world suddenly ganging up on you.  The option of hacking your way across the world generally will not bring success.\n",
       "Of course, this means that the game forces you to look at the picture --- managing a budget, allocating your resources, managing your domestic & religious policies, and wielding diplomacy as a weapon just as effective as your armies --- and that all adds up to a pretty steep learning curve.  It will take more than a few tries before your national engine is firing on all cylinders.  Paradox has a great forum, with a very active posting community.  Just about any question you may have has been addressed on one forum or another.\n",
       "In theory, you can play a couple of hundred nations --- ranging from the major powers of Europe, the pipsqueak principalities of Europe (sometimes simply surviving is a victory in and of itself), or a 3rd world nation such as Mali, Dai Viet or Chimu.  The reality is that this game is heavily Eurocentric.  You can play a New World nation such as Cherokee & Creek, but you will lack the resources and wherewithal to make any significant improvements in technology.  Centuries will whiz by as you stare at the same dozen provinces, with barely any improvements in technology.  Then you will get the pleasure of watching the English, Spanish or French swoop in and gut you like a fish.\n",
       "If you aren't going to play Europe, stronger non-European nations such as Delhi and China will give you a fighting chance.  Playing Persia, the Mameluks or the Ottomans will also give you the chance (possibly) of sweeping across Europe, leaving havoc in your wake.  Few things provide more pleasure.\n",

Being a history buff, any game which allows me to conquer the world in the Age of Mercantilism is a dream come true so you can imagine how quickly I picked this one up.  Actually, I started playing the series with the first game and if you're new to the entire Europa Universalis line, I recommend you begin with the sequel which doesn't add an incredible amount of new content but is a better play than the first game.  Historically accurate rules and the ability to play any country from Spain to the Aztec Empire is what makes this game a classic.  War isn't as simple and one-dimensional as a classic turn-based strategy game such as Civilization or popular real-time strategy game such as Age of Empires.  While technically the game is real-time strategy (RTS), it really doesn't feel like it as it's a different approach from your typical RTS title. You can easily change the speed of the game by slowing down the progression of months and essentially turning the game into a turn-based strategy game which is the best and necessary way to play in most areas of the game. The game allows multiplayer and speaking of online communities, Europa Universalis may have one of the smartest PC gaming communities in existence. Check out the company's message boards for plenty of custom mods and in-depth history discussions.  While you're at it, make sure to download any patches as well because the entire Europa Universalis line has a notorious reputation for buggy releases.

       "It is a strength because you are immersed in something like the world of the 15th century and beyond. You can follow even obscure states through 300 years of their history.\n",
       "But the weakness of historical accuracy is that the game forces you into the groove of actual history. It does this using several more or less hidden factors. First, innumerable historically based, programmed events will give you unique opportunities or shock your country out of tranquility with little regard to what you have done to merit them. Second, your territories have cultures that are entirely inflexible, as does your government. If you hold territories that have cultures different from those of your government you will never have peace, no matter how many centuries you have held them. This gives you a strong incentive to steer clear of them in the first place. Finally, your government belongs to one of five technology groups, all with different rates of technological development. If you are in a slow (i.e., non-European) group, you will eventually be overwhelmed by European conquerors.\n",
       "The game is fun and replayable. But the more or less determined outcomes for individual states makes playing anything but a medium to large European power either boring or frustrating. The game also lacks any tactical aspect. On the whole, much better than anything else in strategy, and in tactics and resource management very poor compared to offerings like Medieval Total War or Age of Kings.</td><td>A38CHY4HZ7O3TR</td><td>Berkeley Gamer</td><td>{\"Platform:\":\" PC\"}</td><td>Fun intro to European history</td><td>1041984000</td><td>false</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>B000MXIMKK</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Perfect</td><td>A15EE9JFAUB7W8</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>{\"Size:\":\" 36W x 34L\",\"Color:\":\" Graphite\"}</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1452816000</td><td>true</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00005QIR3</td><td>null</td><td>2.0</td><td>I can apreciate the work that went into creating a game with this degree of complexity, and I really wanted very much to love this game. However, I have to give it 2 stars for an overall rating of how fun it is to play. I get the impression from the on-line discussion boards that in order to do well at this game, you need to devote yourself to it on a more-or-less full-time basis for months, if not years. If you don't have the time to make that kind of committment to make to a computer game, you might find this rough going.\n",
       "I found the overall design to be satisfactory, and I like the way you can easily group, ungroup, regroup, and maneuver your armies. It would be nice to be able to exert more control over what your armies are doing once they engage in combat (the only combat control you can exercise is to choose to flee; the resolution of battles occurs automatically, without your control), but that is minor point for me. You can also exercise considerable control over many aspects of your society, such as your tolerance for other religions, the degree to which you want to specialize in land or naval power, whether you want to be innovative or closed-minded, and so on. There is a lot here to like.\n",
       "However, there are two big issues that reduce the fun (and the replayability) for me. The first is the constant problem of revolutions. As another reviewer pointed out, you should plan to spend hours of real time endlessly shuttling your armies around trying to stamp out one revolution after the next. This is astoundingly tedious after awhile. The second is the fact that you are completely locked in to the real history of your country. If you are playing China, and China historically suffered a huge government scandal in 1699, when 1699 rolls around you are screwed no matter how you've played so far. It occured to me that the point of the game is not really to expand your empire, but to try your hand at re-playing actual historyy. This does have its interesting moments, but it zaps the replayability to 0. Do I really want to play Spain again and go through all the exact same historically driven events over agin? Not really.\n",
       "This locked-in history also really limits the number of countries that you can expect to play enjoyably. Yes, it's often said that there are 200 countries, and you can play any of them. However, the historical inevitability built into the game limits the fun factor for most. Few countries are even able to explore the world beyond their known lands, because you need special exploring units to all you to venture into new map zones, and the historically colonial countries just have a built-in edge in the number of explorers they receive. You can play the Inca empire if you'd like to spend several hours staring at the same 20 provinces, with no way to explore beyond them.\n",
       "Overall, I have to say that I don't really consider this to be a \"game.\" It is more like a very detailed history sim. Judging from the positive reviews here and the on-line message boards, there are plenty of people out there who love this, and I can see how that might be possible for someone who has lots and lots and lots of time to spend learning it, and who does not mind the built-in history.

       "1.) The nature of exploration is unrealistic. Because all military units have an attrition rate that increases with time, you cannot send out long expeditions (making circumnavigation impossible). Also, you can't bring ships into a safe harbor in unknown lands to refresh the crew.\n",
       "2.) When you discover the new world empires (Aztecs, etc.), they are treated exactly the same as the old world countries politically. This means you have to have a valid cause to attack them. In history, the cultures of the new world were exempted from the rules of war.\n",

Let me first say that I've seen these systems and my opinions are non bias and factual. Let me begin with the PS2 which was launched last year. It created so much hype yet lived up to so much. To my the PS2 is a replica of the PS1 with a DVD player, better graphics, and titles very close to or about the same as PS1, for crying out loud it plays PS1 games, the controller is literally the same without the exception of pressure-sensitive buttons. But PS2 has some really good games no doubt about that, but its also been out for a year so it's expected to have great games. Now onto the Gamecube why would you spend a hundred dollars less than the Xbox and get less than half of the specs of the Xbox. Why do you say the Xbox is a PC? It is not, the OS in Xbox is designed specifically WITH GAMING IN MIND for easy developement. XBox has a hard drive to give gamers the usability, and easibility of ripping of music from their own CD's, and the hard drive prevents horrendous $$$ and time on memory cards. The hard drive also speeds things up a lot. The XBox comes with a built in ethernet port for direct access to the net. The XBox has a DVD player allowing games to run off of 4.5 GB discs. The GC is also a great system it has some really cool games coming out but they don't fit my description of hardcore gaming. Pikmin, and Luigis Mansion aren't really my type; whereas, Resident Evil, and Perfect Dark are. But why would I want to settle for a graphics card that can boast 6-12 million polygons per second; whereas, the Xbox has a graphics card 2 generations ahead of the best PC, its also made by one of the most respectable GPU companies; nVidia. You know Microsoft is losing about $125 off each system to match and paralell with other systems. If you don't find my review very helpful, then simply go to a store do a side by side comparision of all three and if you pay attention, and go with an unbiased opinion you'll see which system boasts the best, sound, graphics, and gameplay. Another factor; sound... Xbox comes with AC3 sound, I have a really high end system and I would love to push an XBox to the limit and potential of DD 5.1. I still don't have an XBox but I recently ordered one. The launch titles were the most appealing to me than the GC's were. Microsoft is new to this field, so was Sony back in '95 and look at where it's at right now. I hope the GC and XBox both are great systems. If you invested in the GC you didn't do the wrong thing, I'm not saying that, I'm saying that you picked a system which appealed to you, and you picked a company which has a generally good rep. in this field, and there are also great games for the GC. But; I find the XBox more appealing to me, and that's why I chose it. If I were you I'd just go to a local store and do a comparision, your opinion might change, or it might stay the same...

Wrestlemania, i like this style over the Smackdowns on Ps2.\n",
       "All the other games i saw didn't interest me. Sports games come out for everything and if one company does get sole rights to em another company will come out with something good at about the same time. Like with Madden and Nfl 2k series. Both of them are just as good as the other case closed.\n",
       "Overall, i wish i could buy the x-box for just Halo and Dead or alive 3 but i cannot justify the extra hundred bucks. I wish i had both of these systems but in my opinion the games are going to be there more for Nintendo and i would rather have the extra cash to go buy two more games than i would for just the x-box.\n",

Also the status element of gaining rank for privileges to weapon smiths and stores are really satisfying.

Your are your own creator.\n",

       "Gameplay:\n",
       "As stated, getting used to the controls is tricky.  The game was primarily designed as keyboard only.  The mouse was only added in on the recommendation of a magazine, and it shows.  This, however, is only a minor fault as a little gameplay will easily get past this design decision.  The game is fairly open-ended, especially towards the beginning, when you spend your time learning who is who.  It's also fairly challenging, in the beginning you can go anywhere, your only limitations being the strength of the wildlife around you.  As you get stronger, your world thusly enlarges until you have free reign of the prison camp.  This allows for hours of fun for those who like to wander and explore.  The game also has little niceties that add to the worldly flavor like being able to cook your meat, mine ore, make stew, blacksmith some swords, etc.  Days cycle, and they take their time doing it.  The day-night cycle takes around 72 minutes, which is long enough to 'feel' right.  The NPCs have daily routines, so at midnight, they'll be in their homes, while daytime will find them hard at work.  This level of detail is hard to find nowadays.  The only gameplay problems that occur have to do with the complexity of running a storied game in a freeform world.  Since you can kill anyone you want, you might find yourself killing someone that advances the story.  This problem is easily solved by the old RPG mantra: save now, save often.\n",
       "Graphics:\n",
       "This game is starting to show its age.  Sure there are low polygon counts, and sure the textures look bland, but hey - that's what 8x AA is for.  This game is one that ignores the prevalent trend of graphics first, content second.  The game's engine is still complex enough to allow for amazing vistas with its far horizon and sundry landscape.  The 4 year-old graphics will be the last thing on your mind once you get into this puppy.\n",
       "Sound:\n",
       "The sound is nice; it's your standard pre-EAX ditty.  No noticeable environments, but again, no one is complaining.  The ambiance is well thought out and I can swear more modern games have stolen Gothic's soundtracks as the music seems very familiar.  Everything is voice-acted and done quite well.  The weapon, magic and enemy sounds are varied enough to keep you interested and there was never a time when I ever wanted to play on mute.\n",
       "Overall:\n",
       "I highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone who enjoys a good, well-thought, RPG.  The decisions you make in the beginning and the sheer pleasure of the game will even allow for substantial replays as you go after the stories threads you had to pass on your first time through.\n",

You're thrown into an immense island prison fill with warring factions, orcs, mages, skeletons, and any number of other deadly monsters.  Beautiful graphics and a multithreaded smooth storyline mean you can easily stay up until 4 am with this game without ever realizing it.  Gothic gets just about everything right, from the storyline itself, which is interesting but never onerous, to the vast array of goodies you can loot.  Everything from blueberries to a hundred different types of swords can be purchased or tracked down in the wild, and the island is filled with hidden caves, high mountain trails, and other mysterious areas that draw you in and then, well, tend to get you killed.  One of the great things is that fights between humans don't end in fatalities unless you activate a special kill command once your opponent is on the ground; so you can mug or be mugged without permanent harm aside from the occasional glare.  The 3D engine runs very smoothly, and there are very few bugs or glitches.  Voice quality is very high; long discussions often occur but don't grate on one's nerves because they're interesting to listen to, and a robust journal keeps track of and _organizes_ the tidbits along the way so you can find what you're looking for at a glance.  Replay value is extremely high given the half dozen exclusive alliances you can pick from, as well as the very customizable nature of your character.  Gothic has pretty much everything; if you don't want to be some super mage or killer barbarian, you can be a thief, or a merchant, or some combination of all four.

The story has a beginning, middle and end - each of which is satisfying. As the story moves along, so does your character, both in power and in recognition in the world. NPCs treat you differently depending on how powerful you are, and they change their stance toward you during the course of the game. When I first tried to take out the bandit camp by the Troll Focus I was rudely rebuffed. When I came back later the entire camp ran away from me - a reasonable course of action considering my powers at the time. Furthermore, Gothic does not suffer from some of the flaws that made me dislike Neverwinter Nights and Morrowind. Both of those games suffer from my pet peeve: thousands of NPC's, all of whom say exactly the same thing. While there is some of that going on in Gothic, the variety of the NPC's personalities make the game a pleasure to play. The combat is good (another problem with Morrowind, if not NWN) and the controls become second nature. I played as a mage and was able to use my magical abilities to win the final battle - I never raised my sword once during it - something most other games of the action/adventure set have tremendous trouble with. There are some things I wish the plot had done differently. For example, I wish we knew more about the protagonist - why was he put in the prison colony in the first place? Also I would have loved for him to have some sort of love interest. They sort of teased you, having him show some concern for the woman sent in with the shipment in the first scene. Overall, this is easily the best game I have played all year, and I echo some of the other reviewers in wondering what the Gamespot people were smoking when they rated this in the sevens?

It is an exceptional RPG with a good story line and mix between action and adventure. I only hesitate to give the game 5 stars for a few distinct reasons.  First, the game claims 100+ hours of gameplay.  It took me 25 the first time and I explored EVERYTHING.  So, I figured out how the developers managed to come up with 100 hours: the loading times.  This game takes FOREVER to load.  I decided to time it eventually when I got so sick of waiting, it was over 5 minutes of loading time.  The min system specs are way too low, I played with a system above recommended and had those problems.  Another complaint people have had is the control scheme, but it really isn't that bad, I actually found it easy to use.  Lastly, the game claims to be non-linear, but the only truly non-linear aspect is the first of 6 chapters in the game, which is choosing which camp to join.  After that, the game is the same no matter how you approach it.  The ending was too easy, but I think getting there was the exciting part.\n",
       "Without mentioning these above items, Gothic is beyond entertaining.  You truly can explore *anywhere* on the map, just be prepared to get killed from tougher monsters there.  The quests are great, and there are a few side quests to try for the experienced player (i.e. chromanin).  I enjoyed coming back to the old camp at the end of the game as a templar from the Brotherhood and slaughtering Gomez and all the guards, with fireballs and storm clouds flying everywhere.

My RPGs include all of the Zelda games, some of the earlier Final Fantasies (i.e. before Playstation), all the Breath of Fires, and so forth.  However, it wasn't until Gothic came along that I realized just how enveloping an RPG could be.\n",
       "First, I'll mention Gothic's flaws:  As one reviewer already mentioned, the manual is useless.  This error is compounded by the fact that the controls are not very intuitive; to pick something up, you have to look at the object to highlight it, hold down the use key, then press the forward key.  Nothing like any other games out there, is it?  Once I figured that out, however, the controls actually became instinct, and I learned the combat system fairly well, since it is based directly on the same system that lets you pick things up.\n",
       "Another flaw that I encountered with the game was how easily you could circumvent yourself by accidentally (or purposefully, for that matter) killing an important NPC or going into an area that you aren't supposed to be able to get into until later in the game.  You can, as one reviewer stated, lock yourself out from beating the game.  This, in my opinion, seemed like an oversight on the part of the developers, but who knows.\n",
       "Now on to the good parts:  This was the first fully free-roaming, open-ended RPG that I have ever played, and that experience was awesome.  The world, including the graphics and sound, seems so realistic that it draws you in from the beginning of the game.  There is no class system per se; you just choose your alliances and your character is open to develop in any direction that you choose.  Want a ranger?  Give all your skill points to your bow marksmanship abilities.  Want a brawler?  Give all your skill points to your fighting abilities.\n",
       "The NPCs all seem like believable characters; they remember your alliances and how you have treated them since you last spoke to them.  The ones who like you will help you along; the ones who despise won't, and may even try to kill you.  The great thing about it is that it's all up to you.\n",
       "Therein lies the great things about this game.  I played Morrowind for a while, but it just doesn't draw you in the way that Gothic does.  Morrowind, in my opinion, while it does have lots of subquests, there's almost too much to do.  The map is so big that if you want to go somewhere where a siltstrider doesn't go, or you can't get there by way of the mages guild, and you don't have the boots of blinding speed, you get to walk.  For a long time.  For me, Morrowind was just TOO open-ended.  Gothic is just as open-ended, but everything leads up to beating the game.  Whereas, in Morrowind, you're never obligated to actually beat the game, Gothic does prod you along in that direction, though not forcefully.\n",
       "The ending to Gothic was a let down, but the experience is well worth it.

       "Gothic just feels real.  People look alive and move as if they were.  The graphics are beautiful.  This game is really enjoyable for the experienced gamer who loves suprises and does not like to be handheld throughout the course of a game.  I recommend playing this game as though you only have one life (example: Run from battle when you are low on life, and don't do anything that will get you killed, because it probably will.  One instance of this could be challenging a guy who looks ten times as strong as you to an arena fight, then wondering why he knocks you out and takes your money.)  Playing with wit adds a lot of excitement to this game.  Dont make the mistake of constantly saving and reloading your game.\n",
       "Gothic gives me the same fun factor as \"Zelda a Link to the Past\" did for the Super Nintendo.

It has great graphics, and the world has a very \"real\" feeling, but it is marred by a few flaws. First, since the game was translated from German, at times the manual appears to be written by a junior-high age gamer. For example, the actual manual description of the sleep spell is:\"zzzZZZzzz\". Instead of telling how the game works, the manual spends half its space giving little hints on how to survive. While this is useful, it would be better if told to you during the game. However, my biggest gripe about the game is the controls. The game basically uses the direction buttons, the mouse, and the control key. There are a few other keys that are used, but by and large to do something you hold control and press \"up\". If you hold control and press \"left\" in front of a chest, you'll try to pick the lock. The game doesn't tell you how to do that, you just have to figure it out. The manual leaves a lot of things out. For example, I was trying to buy one thing from a merchant, but I could only buy ten of them, unless there were eleven of them, in which case I could select ten items, then the last one, then send ten items back, leaving one for me to purchase. It SHOULD NOT be that difficult to buy one item from a merchant in an otherwise realistic/intuitive game. I don't like learning this game via trial-and-error, because decisions you make will permanently alter what is going on in the game. For example, I challenged a person to a duel (not to the death) in one arena, he beat me unconscious, took my money, and refused to ever fight me again. None of this was explained to me before I challenged him. This is an allegory for this game - you make one mistake because the game and manual didn't warn you, and the game holds it against you for the rest of the game.\n",

This game was a welcome relief from the usual routine of creating a party of fighters, mages, a thief, and a healer. I like getting tied up in one character much better. One can get through the game with his or her favorite style of play. You can either clobber everyone in your way with the biggest sword, pick your enemies off from a distance with a bow, dish out damage with offensive spells (Fire! Fire!), or get by your enemies using teleportation or shapeshifing. The story itself avoids many of my usual video game annoyances through good writing and plausible explanations for limits of the videogame world. First of all, you can explore in any direction you want to, but the world does come to an end at the magic barrier that contains the prison your character has been thrown into. The flexible storyline depends on which of three different factions you choose to join in the prison (just like Oz on HBO!). One of the nicest touches of all is how skills are learned. You don't just automatically level after X amount of experience points, you need to find a skilled teacher who likes you enough to teach you for a favor or the right amount of ore. Then, the NPC actually tells you things about what you're learning how to do! You also have to work your way up through the heirarchy of the camp before you meet the most important NPCs. Access to significant parts of the game world is not limited by waiting for someone to tell you about a quest so that it suddenly appears on your map, but only by the presence of guards who won't let you in to see the boss or by monsters you are not yet strong enough to fight. The joy of this game is not the destination, but the 50 hour journey. The main character begins as a wimp who could be devoured by the dinosaur babies in the land before time and ends up to be a powerhouse who can truly declare to the guard at the gate \"I'm here to take on the whole camp\", which by the way I did. Before completing the game as a templar from the swamp camp, I slaughtered the guards from the old camp who were so rude to me at the beginning. The weaker members of the camp ran away in terror as I threw fireballs and swung a magic two-handed sword. But I believe whoever plays this adventure will work their own personality and gameplay preferences to get an experience a variable as the person playing the game! I don't give out five stars too often, but the graphics, fully explorable world, and well written, branching plot make this game a rare experience.

You are a messenger from outside the realm, which is inhabited by mercenaries, thieves, wizards, and monsters, who have taken over their magically induced prison. Who do you trust?

Skirmish mode lets you play against a number of computer controlled opponents. You choose a country that is either part of the Soviets or the Allies. Each country has their own special unit, some that were not included in the campaign. You can also play online but I'm pretty a lot of practice is required.

       "\n",
       "The two big attractions for Red Alert 2 are its unique units and its unashamedly B-Grade Movie Acting cheese factor. Firstly - to the units. Because RA2 isn't based on any real-life scenarios (Soviet Union invades America? Please.), this gives the developers creative freedom to create the craziest units imaginable. So we have soldiers with rocket packs (Rocketeers), Tanks that can camouflage themselves (Mirage tanks), and shock troopers that fire lightning bolts (Tesla Troopers). To this very day, the units in Red Alert 2 are still my favourites of all time.\n",
       "\n",
       "The second big attraction is how RA2 revels in its B-Grade movie roots. It was a huge surprise because so many game developers take the \"grim and gritty\" route. Red Alert 2 wallows unashamedly in its own cheesiness. It also introduced some very memorable characters. Udo Kier is suitably very creepy (in a cheesy way) as the Pscyhic Yuri. Tanya (played by Kari Wuhrer) - in addition to being a useful unit in the game, she's played with real charm and feistiness. There's Ray Wise as the US President, who's clearly sending up Bill Clinton. And finally, one of my favourite game characters of all time - General Carville, played brilliantly by Barry Corbin. He gets some great lines - one of my favourites is \"I'm sick and tired of living in Canada. Get me my office back!\". And his delivery really fires you up and makes you want to kick some Soviet [...].\n",
       "\n",
       "That (to me) is what separates Red Alert 2 from any other game before or since. It flatly refuses to take itself seriously and invites the player to have a lot of fun.

This game is great! Much better then Red Alert or even Tiberian Sun, Red Alert 2 keeps a basic concept of all Command and Conquer games but enhances the fun and gameplay in it.  The storyline is very well put together even though it's not very realistic. The storyline is simple: The Soviet Union is invading the United States and all of Europe in a revenge attempt from the first war they lost in the original Red Alert. There are 2 campaigns in which you can play. You can play as the Allies and stop the Soviets and destroy them or play as the Soviets and conquer America and the rest of the world. Both campaigns are very interactive and fun in which you fight in major cities throughout the world such as New York, Washington D.C., Miami, St. Louis, Colorado Springs, Paris, Moscow and many more and fight in countries like the United States, France, Russia, Poland, Mexico, Cuba and other territories. Much of the fighting is in an urban enviroments. You can garrison buildings and destroy famous landmarks.\n",
       "Each side, the Allies and Soviets have their own special units. They both have the basic infantry unit: The American G.I. and the Soviet Conscript. The difference is that the G.I. is stronger and costs more, while Conscipts are weak and cheap to build in mass numbers. Soviet tanks have stronger armor but Allied tanks can have more firepower like Prism or Mirage Tanks. The building is easy: buy it and place it on the ground and go up the tech-tree to become more powerful. Basiclly you build and kill in every mission which can become boring but each mission has its own purpose and which units to build. Each side has a navy and airforce as well, however the American air power is much more powerful then the Soviet Air Force. Getting money is simple by building miners and collecting ore to build buildings, base defense, soldiers etc. The units are not as balanced as they are in Tiberian Sun which makes it more unique for both sides. Each side has superweapons like nuclear missiles or weather storms and even invincible devices or teleporting machines.\n",
       "There are cut-scene videos in between missions which are very entertaining to watch. Real Actors! *WARNING*Known to be cheesy though.

The same details apply and you can play different forms  like free for all or deathmatches. The internet is not as well rounded as Starcrafts but still fun. Overall multiplayer is fun. The sound in the game is good and has different mixes to it and the units talk when you click on them. The game concept is fun and controlling hundreds of units can be a challenge but exciting. There is even a basic training course to help you. This game has everything a RTS should have and I have no complaints.\n",

In fact, this is not quite true. Speaking purely technically, this game offers what the other side of the Command and Conquer saga never could:an experience which was at least close to par with that of an actual wartime environment. See, the alternate side of the saga, or that which concerns the two warring organizations NOD and GDI, usually, at least from what I have seen of it, focused on \"infiltration\", Where as Red Alert, or at least Red Alert 2, focused mainly on \"invasion\". Look at the facts: in the command and conquer saga, units are stronger, more impervious to damage, they cost more, and the standard base (at least in Tiberian Sun)are protected by things such as automated security gates, guard towers, etc. Yet, in the Red Alert series, units are cheap, larger amounts of money are more easily acquired, units are more easily destroyed, and bases have no need for things like security gates and guard towers, but rather pill boxes and prism towers. These are all things that constitute the existence of large invasion forces composed of similar units. Yet, why then, I'm sure you ask, did I give the game only four stars? Well, very simply, I did it because the premise is SO rediculous. The reunification of the Soviet Union and their subsequent invasion of the United States? It's just too unlikely a premise. The title of \"Premier\" doesn't even exist over there anymore. Anyway, I also had to go against the movies that play between mission. Westwood: please try to get rid of some of the cheese in some of the cut scenes, for god's sake.

I travel about 75% of the time for work so I need clothes that travel well. These most certainly do. I also like that they are a light weight material. I honestly find them more comfortable than jeans. Another bonus feature of these pants is that they have a hidden expandable waist band. Gaining a little weight? No problem these pants have you covered. They are built in such a way that you can't see it from the outside,  but they allow the waistline to slide in and out. There is no elastic visible in the waist from the outside looking in. I have been buying these exact same pants for a few years now. I have ruined a few pairs from hotel irons. They are susceptible to scorching on the board if you are not careful. This goes with the territory of travelling all the time. I am also a freak about my appearance,  so a normal person probably doesn't need to iron them but I do.\n",

The people are rather chunky and pixilated, but everyting else (buildings, vehicles, explosions) look great, especially at high resolutions.

Basically, if you have ever played Counter-Strike or any game like that where it just gives you a plain view of your local games, don't expect that in this game. Upon opening up the package, you will see 2 discs, the Soviet (my favorite) and the Allied. There different in ways like unit types, tech trees, and so on. The game is set in the future, so expect to see mind controling devices and tesla coils.

The game also doesn't have some of the problems that Tiberian Sun Possessed.  In TS, the AI would just send a thousand sacrificial Engineers to your camp, you kill 999 of them, but one of them always made it through and took over your construction yard.

It features 2 campaigns, 1 for each side, that walk you through the plot and train you for the regular battles ahead. There is a skirmish mode, which lets you play a multiplayer-style game with the AI. I once used this mode to re-inact the Bay of Pigs invasion, there are so many little options. True fun comes, though, with multiplayer mode, which is the main focus of the game.\n",
       "Although in previous C&Cs, especially Tiberian Sun, there was a quite a lot of blood and gore when an infantry guy got killed, Red Alert 2 has NO Blood and NO Gore. In fact, when an infantryman is killed now, sometimes he'll say things like \"Do'h!\" and then fall over and disappear. Still, it's rated \"T\"like most strategy games. No swearing, either; the president says in the intro movie, \"I wouldn't give a wooden nickel about your legacy.\"\n",

       "At first glance, the game units and graphics almost look like they were taken straight out of a cartoon compared to past CC games. But you'll soon come to appriciate the graphics and the visuals. The units are fairly large; no more losing units in the background. Both the Soviets and the Allies have some impressive new units and some good ole' renditions from the old RA game. The Tesla Coil is back, and now, the Tesla trooper is a mainstay. The allies have some beefed up troops, who can deploy into stationary gunners that can be the bane of advancing Soviet troops. And let's not forget Professor Einstein and all his wonderful creations that he's going to cook up for the allies. Yes, the Soviets are not as technically advanced, but you'll love the brute force that they possess. You'll know no horror like when you're playing the allies and you suddenly see 10 Zepplins heading straight for your base. Ouch time.\n",
       "The cinimatics are better than most game movies, but they are fairly cheesy in some points (like the end movie for the allies).

Pikmin is an innovative and seriously charming RTS (Real-time strategy) game, where you harvest (or pull, rather) little carrot-shaped living plants out of the ground and have them do your bidding for you; Pikmin can assist in taking down enemies, gathering seeds (so you can produce more Pikmin creatures for you), and are essential for carrying back parts of your spaceship that you lost on the planet. This game has really stood the test of time and is still highly enjoyable, inventive, and challenging, even today. The only real downside to Pikmin, as opposed to Pikmin 2, is that you only have 30 days to find all of Olimar's Spaceship parts.</td><td>AL3H0W1HI9G2U</td><td>Joe Boyce</td><td>{\"Format:\":\" Video Game\"}</td><td>An ingenious game inspired by Miyamoto's garden</td><td>1335312000</td><td>true</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B000MXQ2CU</td><td>null</td><td>2.0</td><td>A little small</td><td>A1I1XJLNPTORPM</td><td>Jesus O.</td><td>{\"Size:\":\" 38W x 32L\",\"Color:\":\" British Khaki\"}</td><td>Two Stars</td><td>1495238400</td><td>true</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00005Q8LY</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>This was the 2nd of 3 older games requested by my teenage granddaughter (she loves the older games sometimes on older systems).

It is a great game and I am glad I bought it. There are great graphics and a very creative form of battle. You play as a 2cm tall alien named Olimar from planet Hocotate and you crash on a distant plaet (earth). The goal is to collect your 30 ship parts which have been scattered all over earth. All seems hopeless when suddenly you find a small spacecraft. It resembles an onion so that is what Olimar names them. Suddenly, the onion springs into the air and sprouts \"legs.\" Then, a red seed pops out. This is a Pikmin seed. You then have to bring food back to the onion using the Pikmin. As you bring food to the onion, more seeds pop out. Eventually, you find your ship's engine. This allows you to go to the next area: the Forest of Hope. There' you find a yellow onion. Out pops a yellow Pikmin seed. These Pikmin can carry small bombs to break down walls or defeat enemies. After finding a number of ship parts, you can go to a cavern in the forest called the Forest Navel. You find a blue onion submerged in a small pond there. When you approach it, it jumps up and spits out a blue Pikmin seed. These blue pikmin can actually breath underwater! After that, you have to find the rest of your ship parts to go to the Distant Spring. This area has nothing to offer but strong enemies and ship parts. There are about 10 parts here! After finding them all, you have to go to the final level: the Final Trial. Here, you have to fight a huge enemy called the Emporer Bulbax. After killing it, it spits out a piggy bank. after carrying this back to your ship, you are ready to take off. Olimar bids the Pikmin goodbye and flys off in his ship back to Hocotate. It sounds easy but there is a catch, you have to beat the game in 30 in-game days. The days last about 15 minutes so you should be able to get at least one part a day.

       "Pikmin's core game play itself has the makings of a perfect game: Grow and harvest criminally cute little colorful carrot people and then use them to complete various tasks and chores in order to recover enough pieces of your damaged spacecraft until you can leave the alien planet you're stranded on. (i.e. Earth) The Pikmin come in three colors and each color has its own strengths and weaknesses. You must command your Pikmin to knock down obstacles, build bridges, defeat enemies, carry parts back to the ship, and grow more Pikmin. You have to set Pikmin to a task and leave them to it while you go and direct more Pikmin to do something else. This in itself could have been gaming nirvana. But then Miyamoto decided to take it a step further: You have only 30 \"days\" to complete the mission (1 day in the game = approx. 15 minutes of actual playing time) Quite a bit of strategy is necessary, or you'll fail and have to start all over.\n",
       "\n",
       "While it's not all that difficult to finish the game before time's up, it does add an unwelcome sense of pressure and stress to what otherwise could have been a delightful and even relaxing game to play. The playfulness and sheer whimsy is overshadowed by a dark cloud of impending doom. When you could have been happily cheering your Pikmin on as they do your bidding, you may instead find yourself cursing at them. \"Faster, you little morons! Faster! No, not that way you idiots! THAT way! Damn you! Damn you all to Vegetable Hell!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It was the time limit that prevented me from completing Pikmin back when it was released. Not because I was unable to, but because I stopped playing due to the stress outweighing the fun. I've completed it recently, because I want to play Pikmin 2 (which has no time limit, thank God) with a clear conscience. One of my solutions to facing the 30 day challenge was to get into the habit of \"scouting.\" You can only save your progress at the end of each day. At the beginning of each new day, the first thing I would do is explore the level (alone, without any Pikmin tagging along) to look for ship pieces, take note of obstacles, enemies, and the general lay of the land. Once I'd formulated a plan to get that piece back to the ship, I'd reset the Gamecube and reload my save file so I could have the entire day (i.e. 15 minutes) to achieve my goal. On the best days, I was able to retrieve a whopping TWO ship pieces. In my opinion, Pikmin should have let you take as many days as you needed to complete the game, and they could have offered a \"Challenge Mode\" with a time limit to satisfy the more hardcore gamers out there. As it stands, I now admit that this -is- a fun and addictive game. However, it could have been so much better and I would have finished it when I originally bought it instead of three years later. I'm grading it on a curve, a curve set by Miyamoto himself with games like Super Mario World, Yoshi's Island, Legend of Zelda- A Link to the Past, Super Mario 64, and LoZ- Ocarina of Time.</td><td>AT576Z9DC6HJ0</td><td>D.

       "It is a masterpiece. This game in the most innovative and unique game of the 2001 by far, and one of the funnest. The storyline ride shotgun to the gameplay and minus one cutscene it is nonexistent. But ill tell you the little there is. Pint sized (2 inches to be exact) Captain Olimar is taking a small vacation in his spaceship the Dolphin when a meteor hits his ship hurtling him to the planet below, all 50 of the primary parts to his ship are scattered across the land and the planets atmosphere is filled with deadly oxygen! (who knows what the little guy breathe!) Well bring on the pikmin! Captain Olimar finds there 'Onion' (pikmin spaceship) and one seed falls out, Capt. Olimar picks the resulting sprout and lo and behold it turns out to be an animal! Slightly smaller then Olimar what help can it do? Well if you experiment you can find the pikmin can carry pellets to the onion and grow more pikmin, eventually you willhave around 30 pikmin and you can move the box (Olimar is 2 inches tall remember, so to him the box is HUGE) and find the engine behind it, thus ending the day Capt. Olimar shoot into the sky to find parts the next day, most of the gameplay revolves around leading your army of pikmin (up to a hundred at a time) around the planet defeating enemys and gathering parts, here is where it gets tricky, Olimar has a limited time of 30 game days (around 15 minutes a piece) and he must balance between growing new pikmin and gathering new parts. Trust me this game is not easy, before you freak out its not hard either, its its the upper medium spectrum. All in all its a great game with amazing visuals (best water effects EVER) and worthy of the Miyamoto name. If you have the Game Cube its a must buy. The only bad thing I can say is lack of multiplayer and the time limit is a bit harsh at times.

       "The story: Some bald, fat guy is flying around in a spaceship and he gets hit by an astroid, then he lands on some weird planet and discovers Pikmin. Parts of the spaceship are scattered around the world and the guy decides to make the Pikmin help him. So, the Pikmin help him and he flies away like the happy little fat guy he is.\n",
       "Oh, but Nintendo decides that leaving it there would make things too easy. So, they decide to throw in a time limit... what fun! *sarcasm* You have 30 \"days\" to get 30 parts and the day goes by in about 15 minutes. Ah, Nintendo, what a big mistake that was. You're forcing players to rush through the game, instead of  just enjoying it. I wouldn't mind this so much if the time limit was longer, though. Because, let's not forget, you made the parts darn near IMPOSSIBLE to find!\n",
       "And about the Pikmin... they die too easily, for one thing. I mean, if they get touched by an enemy... they're dead. If they touch water... they're dead. If you leave the planet to fly around in your spaceship for a night and you leave some Pikmin behind... they're dead. It's funny how we're supposed to depend on these little weaklings to defend us against giant... mushroom... dog things... that want to eat us.\n",

Very few who know his name will argue that point, and fewer still will argue the quality of his work. As perhaps the greatest asset still under Nintendo's grasp, his fame is surprisingly low-key. Little more than the most hard-core gamers know of his existence, but everyone who's ever seen a joystick has a pretty extensive knowledge of his creations. Super Mario Brothers. Donkey Kong. The Legend of Zelda. Mario Kart. F-Zero. Starfox. Super Smash Brothers. It reads like a top ten list of Nintendo's greatest achievements, and it all stems back to one man. So, naturally, when this guy's motivated to flesh out a new idea it's a pretty newsworthy event.\n",
       "Such was the circumstance when Pikmin was revealed to the world near the launch of the GameCube in late 2001. It was promoted as the system's \"must-have\" launch title, a role in which any of the famed creator's previous titles would have soared. Unfortunately, Pikmin isn't a game I'd classify as a cornerstone in any sense of the word, which is what Nintendo desperately needed at that point in time. Every bit of the Miyamoto-trademarked addictive gameplay, uncensored originality and effortless simplicity is here in full force, but the game never took off because of the way it was marketed. As an understated, unheralded underground success released a year or two after the first-wave launch titles, this game would have taken the gaming world by storm. As the central focus of a next-gen console, it was horribly misplaced and, along with Nintendo itself, quickly lost in the shuffle.\n",
       "Which is a shame, because this is a really enjoyable little package. It tackles a number of cliches that have plagued the gaming scene for years, gathers several completely unrelated genres and produces a game that you've never seen anything even remotely like. It successfully proves that higher framerates, larger numbers of polygons and faster processors haven't completely eliminated the kind of light hearted, inexplicably believable experience that used to fill every game on the old NES and Atari.\n",
       "This isn't the best looking game on the market, nor does it need to be. The real magic of Pikmin is in its simplicity, which is something that's wisely protected by keeping the game's environments understated and clean. It is a little disconcerting to see how flat some of the textures are upon close inspection, but since the majority of the game is played from a distant overhead perspective, this is a minor qualm at best. The Pikmin, Olimar and the enemies, however, skirt this issue as they're all composed of flat colors with little noticeable detailing at all. And though that sounds like a blatant red flag, it's done consistently enough to ward off any presumptions that this might have been done as a last second method of cutting corners. This is a title that appears exactly as it was meant to, with the tiny, brightly colored creatures appearing eerily at home amongst the familiar, photorealistic blades of grass, twigs and soil. It's funny, the graphics of Pikmin fluctuate so easily between distinct realism and blatant oversimplification that the lines themselves start to blur. It becomes the meeting point between detail and simplicity, with an end product that's all the more believable because of that.\n",
       "Upon his discovery of the Pikmin, Olimar also discovers their undying need to follow his direction. Unless he tells them otherwise, nearby Pikmin will follow our central character around the world. They'll put their lives on the line to defend him from much larger adversaries. They'll build bridges for him, or carry enormous objects with the proportionate strength of an ant if it'll aid his journeys. That the game's writers chose not to elaborate on these tiny creatures' undying love for the title's main character makes it all the more interesting and open for interpretation.\n",
       "Whether they fall into the river and drown, attempt to run through a fountain of fire or stupidly assault the largest enemy in the forest on their lonesome, you WILL lose Pikmin in the field on a regular basis, which becomes a point of agony as the game progresses. It's strange to imagine, but after spending the time to create, uproot and command these little creatures, you develop a sort of parental attachment to them, which eventually becomes the real attraction as the hours go on. It's truly disturbing to watch a large forest creature devour a handful of them in one fell swoop, and that's an emotion I don't usually get from playing a video game.\n",
       "It's this element of survival, mixed with a brief, thirty day timeframe (a game day lasts about half an hour) and a series of mind-teasing, difficult puzzles that really gives Pikmin its substantial appeal. There's a definite Lemmings vibe to some of the levels, both with their simplicity and their nerve-wracking addictive nature. You'll spend hours upon hours trying to sort your way through a particularly difficult puzzle, only to discover the answer was right in front of your face the whole time. Everything is arranged to follow a blatant learning curve, but it never really seems to get in the way or detract from the overall picture.\n",
       "As I said before, Pikmin would've made a great second or third year addition to the GameCube's lineup. It's a much deeper game than the simplified graphics of the front cover would lead you to believe, always there to inspire thought rather than to sate your appetite for gratuitous violence. It straddles the action / adventure, strategy and puzzle genres, and stands head and shoulders above the leading titles in each category today. It's a deceptively addicting little package, and though it lacks a bit in length and replay value, it's more than worth the current asking price. There's a very solid concept here, which I hope to see fleshed out a little further in the forthcoming sequel.</td><td>A1TJIJKKN15KR9</td><td>drqshadow</td><td>{\"Format:\":\" Video Game\"}</td><td>Marketed Incorrectly as a Cornerstone Game</td><td>1075334400</td><td>false</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>B000MXIN22</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>I normally wear a 34\" inseam with dress pants, but these extend one inch below the heel on my dress shoes.

       "-The lack or replayability\n",
       "-Having only 3 types of pikmin\n",
       "-Each day being only 15 minutes\n",
       "-The Pikmin are hard to control\n",
       "-The game is too short\n",
       "  Those are the main problems i have read over the reviews of this game. Even if you don't agree with all of those problems i'm sure there's atleast one on that list that you might kind of agree with. If so, let me explain. The thirty day time limit is a way to help you be organized and without it the game would be pointless. When i played the game for the first time i thought it could be frustrating at times but it made me think ahead and i could sometimes even feel my adrenaline pumping because i had less days than i had parts to get.\n",
       "  The lack of replayability does not even exist with this game. I don't understand what replayability is if this game does not have it. If you look up to the manufacturer's review or some reveiew up at the top it says one of the game's strengths is the nonlinear strategic gameplay. That means that you can play all the levels and the tasks required to beat the game in any way you want. For example on day 7 one person might be in the forest naval getting a part when someone else choses to stay in the last are a getting a different part. This is because of the nonlinear gameplay.you could get none or 5 parts in a day. The order of parts isn't even set. This means that there must be thousands of different ways to beat this game. Including how many different days you could beat it in. You could beat the game a second or third time to beat the game in less days. I will be honest that i played and have beaten this game 30 times probably by now. I did that and every time it was different.\n",
       "  People also say it has not enough kinds of pikmin. i think three is the perfect number. And notice the colors(all yellow, red, and blue which are the prime clors meaning you can make any color with those three colors). Each one has it's own ability too. If you still think there should be more just wait for pikmin 2 to come out. there's going to be skinny albinos and pudgey purples.\n",
       "  I also think that each day being 15 minutes was fine. If you think about what your going to do and concentrate you can get up to 4 or 5 parts a day. I have done it and i know it's possible because i have beaten the game in 9 days probably over a dozen times. If you just mess up you can always restart and it's not the end of the world. I also hear people saying that restarting the levels are a pain because they run out of time in each day, but if \"each day is so short\" like they also say then what's the big deal?!\n",
       "  Another thing that people say is that it is hard to control. i must agree that there are a lot of controls, yet it didn't take me long at all to get all of the controls down. I think the more ontrols the better because each control is helpful when attacking enemies. And the constant need of adjusting the camera just means you always have a good angle.\n",

While I cannot say the game is long, I must admit that it wasn't as short as I thought it would be, based on other's feedback.  It incorporates two genres (platform and strategy) successfully into what is really a unique new play experience.  You do have to think about how you will go about several tasks, or you won't be able to complete them.  Pikmin's graphics are wonderful as well.  It is a game that makes me smile rather than feeling down after playing.  Many thanks to Nintendo for not re-hashing the same stuff over and over again as competitors do.

       "The problem with Pikmin (the problem being Miyamoto's Curse) is too big a focus on innovation, so big that no room is left for anything else.  The team that designed Pikmin completely forgot to make sure it was any fun to play!  They didn't even care!  All that mattered to them, it seems, was that their final product be innovative, unique, and full of fancy gimmicks never seen before.

And its very fun getting larger quantities of pikmin so you can do more things at one time. And all the kinds of pikmin have their own unique strengths (example: yellow-throwing molten rocks & jumping higher. blue-is able to swim in water. red-is able to with-stand any fire and/or fire attacks by enemies).

The breath of fresh air that was supposedly going to change the way we look at strategy games is in stores as I type this. Everyone always asks, \"What is Pikmin about, anyway?\" Yet, no one seems to know. So, by reading this review, you will not only find out what the hell it's about, but you will also receive the green light to go pick up this awesome game.\n",
       "  Pikmin is about a strange, size-of-a-Quarter alien-creature named Captain Olimar. The good ol' Captain seems to live a normal human life, as we are told throughout his adventure on this even more strange planet than his. He has a family, and is apparently a Spaceman. He's also a very intelligent being. A meteor hit the Dolphin, which is Captain Olimar's trusty rocket, thus destroying the poor guy's spaceship. Once he lands on this odd planet, he has noticed that he only has 30 Days to stay on this planet, as the air is highly polluted, and his fresh air system will fail in that amount of time. The Captain is also missing 30 Pieces of his Spaceship, the Dolphin. He finds a contraption that sprouts seeds, which he names an \"Onion.\" The seeds, you ask? They are called \"Pikmin.\" These Pikmin are half animal-half plant creatures that will help Mr. Olimar find his ship pieces, and return him home safely.\n",
       "  Well, now that we got that out of the way, let's cut into the beefy center of the game... Pikmin is a strategy game that will control your boredom hours for several days. If you actually have a life, then it will control your boredom hours for several weeks. It's about 12 Hours long, so it's not as short as Luigi's Mansion, but it could be a lot longer. Nonetheless, the game is a MUST OWN if you have a GameCube, and gets my vote for GameCube Game of The Year, without a doubt.\n",
       "  Okay, so now that I've given you the story and the green light to buy this bad boy, I guess you want details, eh? Okay. You can have up to 100 Pikmin on the screen and under your control at once. Pretty nifty, huh? This will come in handy for boss battles. Certain monsters are tiny, some are huge, some roam the land, some swim in shallow water, and some like to fly. What you will have to do is send a pack of 60 or more Pikmin to defeat huge monsters, as they can become a pain in small numbers, and kill most of your poor, innocent little Pikmin. There is nothing more frustrating than planting 60 seeds and having 70 dead Pikmin in return. Tsk, tsk.\n",
       "  Speaking of seeds, once you kill enemies, drag their dead, lifeless bodies back to your \"Onion\" to sprout more Pikmin! That's right, not only will you get parts to your ship for defeating bosses, but if you have enough Pikmin to carry parts and carcasses, then send one pack of Pikmin for a part, and one pack for the seeds.\n",
       "  There are three types of Pikmin; Red Pikmin, which are land animals! They can defeat enemies in a jiffy without dying as much as the blue or yellow, and they are immune to fire. Blue Pikmin, which can swim without a problem, but die easier than the rest, and Yellow Pikmin, who are known for their incredible strength to lift Bombs! How do you get different seeds, you ask? Whichever color Pikmin lifts an object to get de-seeded, that is the color of Pikmin you will get out of that object.\n",
       "  Enough of the mushy-stuff. The real fun lies in Pikmin's amazing perspective on making you think before you do anything. If there is a piece of the Dolphin on a ledge that Captain Olimar cannot get to, throw some Pikmin on top of the ledge, and guide them from there! I would explain more of this incredible feature that makes you use your brain like no game has in years, but that would spoil the fun for you, and why would I want to do that?\n",
       "  You have a clock in the game, and the Pikmin can only be outside from Sunrise to Sundown, as the planet isn't very lit up. So each day, you have around 14 hours to roam around and collect parts. However, these 14 hours go by very fast, and you will find yourself on the next day in no time. Just ask anybody that played Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. They will tell you how fast the time goes. Make sure you have collected all of your Pikmin before time runs out, or the loose Pikmin will become Ladybug-Food. Worried about the time limit? Don't worry! It's what makes the game fun, and this is coming from me, who disliked Majora's Mask because of the same problem.\n",
       "  If you own a GameCube, you must own this game. It's too short, and that is my only complaint. It's still longer than, let's say, Resident Evil, so don't worry on the length of the game. The game also has tons of replay value, and it's so charming, that you will be playing this one for years to come. The game also has that classic Miyamoto \"charm\" in it's writing and feel.

They have large ears and can fly higher than other Pikmin. They also can handle bomb rocks, which are used to knock down stone walls. The third kind are the blue Pikmin. They have gills and are water resistant. You start off with one type of each pikmin, then as you beat creatures,they drop pellets, which are made of nutrients from the things the creatures consume. The pikmin then team up to lift the carcass and pellets back to their onion, or  nest. Here, the objects are regenerated into Pikmin sprouts. If you let the seeds stay in the ground, they will grow into a bud and eventually a flower. When they have been grown fully, they are more efficient. There are 5 beautifully designed stages where the parts have been scattered. Which leads us to our plot. As the miniscule Olimar, you, along with the help of Pikmin, have to get to the rocket parts. You have 30 days to do this. You will see the sun move across the top of the screen, simulating time passing. Overall, the visuals are stunning, the creativity is unequaled, and the plot is great.

The key is to use an effective strategy and multi-task.  The very first time I played, I only got 15 parts in 22 days...not very good.

First, the days are too short, and until you are very experienced, you can hardly do anything in a day.  Second, when you are learning to play, you keep forgetting which button does what and how to move the camera.  It can be very frustrating when you release all your Pikmin instead of throwing one.  I would like to emphasize the poor camera controls.  Also, there is no replayability, as beating the game takes out all the appeal- that is, if you can even like the game well enough to finish it.

The only problem is that Olimar's space suit can only support him for 30 days (Pikmin days, not real days), and he must find 30 parts! On the strange planet, Olimar meets the Pikmin, and he uses them to help navigate his way through the planet while accomplishing important tasks.

Created by Nintendo's star programmer Shigeru Miyamoto (Mario, Zelda, Donkey Kong), Pikmin is a franchise that everyone will be playing for quite some time.  The basic story behind the game, is that a little guy named Captain Olimar was driving his spaceship through space when it was hit by a mediator that sends him spinning out of control onto an unknown planet.  During the freefall, Olimar's ship gets broken up into 30 different parts that Olimar has to find within 30 days before his oxygen tanks run out.  The rest of the game basically involves doing this exact thing.  There are 5 different areas in the game that have Olimar's parts spread out all over them.  Throughout the game, Olimar encounters 3 different color Pikmin that all have different attributes that assist him in his attempt to gather up the 30 parts.  Each day in the game lasts about 13 minutes so the overall length of the game is not that long, but since the game take multiple attempts to master, has 3 different endings, has an added Challenge mode which allows players to duke it out for high scores, Pikmin is a top notch game that is definitely a must have to anyone's GameCube library.</td><td>A3CLEP61OWTYPW</td><td>Mr. De Moss</td><td>{\"Format:\":\" Video Game\"}</td><td>Video Games Reviewer</td><td>1014163200</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B000MXIMKK</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>I bought these for my son.

I was skeptical about Pikmin because of its cutesy look.  Recently though, I've decided that it doesn't matter if the game you're playing looks like something a 6 year old would play; all that matters is that you're having a good time.  And if you think that by playing \"cute\" games you'll be labeled as uncool, I have news for you:  Playing an excessive amount of *any* kind of video game will get you labeled as uncool.\n",
       "Pikmin's graphics are a good start for the GameCube.  The soundtrack is all soothing ambient music that I find makes me think better, and the premise of the game is so simple that it's brilliant:  You're a spaceman who crashed on a weird planet, and you have to recover 30 parts to your spaceship that have been scattered about.  With only 30 days of life support left, the spaceman discovers \"Pikmin\", or little plant creatures that act as helpers for him.  If he needs something carried, he throws Pikmin at it and they do it for him.  Each item that the Pikmin carry requires a certain amount of Pikmin, so you must make more Pikmin in order to get all of the parts back to the space ship.  Pikmin are created by having other Pikmin carry flower pollen (or the corpses of dead predators) to their \"Onion\" space ship; the pollen turns into Pikmin fresh for the picking.  You can have 100 pikmin on the screen at once, and there are different colors of Pikmin that all have different skills and abilities.  The red Pikmin are fireproof for example.\n",
       "The lush levels are innovative and large.  Load time is just about non-existant and the variety of sound effects shouldn't put anyone to sleep.  I found the controls really easy to learn, and became addicted to the game instantaneously.  The enemies and bosses are all really fun to eradicate, and to top everything off, there's a realtime clock that changes the amount of sunlight and shadows in the game.\n",
       "Pikmin does have weak spots though.  It's definitely a short game, though I loved it so much that I know I'll play it over and over.  There are 3 different endings you can get depending on how many ship parts you complete the game with, and there's also a time trial to see how many Pikmin you can raise in a day.  But if you're the kind of person who plays a game just to see an ending, Pikmin will be over pretty shortly.\n",
       "In short, Pikmin is a little bit like Lemmings, a little bit like a real time strategy, a little bit like a puzzle game and a little bit like a Mario game.  If you're sick of getting hammered in the face with games intended to fit into a specific genre (RPGs, RTS, FPS, Sports Games, Fighters), you need Pikmin.

       "This game is awesome. It may look boring, but there's so much to do and so much to explore it always stays fun. The graphics are so realistic when you zoom out all the way, but look kinda cartoonish if you zoom in. The presentation is pretty cool. The sounds and music are probably the best quality of the game. The music is catchy and fun, and the sounds are perfect. The gameplay would be a 10/10, but it kinda gets frusturating when the giant monsters kill a whole bunch of Pikmin. This game is pretty long, and probably takes about 20-25 hours to complete. The lasting appeal is an 8.5/10 because you might want to go back through the game and see if you can complete it faster.

It is directed towards kids, but can be fun for anyone who likes strategy games.  The object of the game is to find all 30 parts of your battered spaceship within a 30 day (each day is roughly 15 minutres long) time limit.  You must use each pikmin's abilities to their fullest to do this such as using yellow pikmin to reach really high places and red pikmin to carry parts over flames.  While it seems simple enough, it can be quite challenging to get all 30 parts.  The enemies of the levels can completely devastate your pikmin population if you send them into dangerous situations without orders.  This game uses a new approach to strategy, and it is by far one of the best games on the gamecube.\n",

       "Captin Olimar, a great space traveler, has crashed-landed on a strange planet after his ship collided with a meteor. After a prilimanary examination of his surroundings, he has looked over his beloved ship, The Dolphin(anyone recognize the code name for Gamecube?). He has discovered that his ship is missing 30 parts apon crash-landing, and if he ever wishes to return to Planet Hoctate where his wife and two children are, he must recover his lost parts. And to make matters worse, he has detected the poisinous gas oxegen in the planets atmosphere, and his life-support will be able to hold out for only 30 more days. Then as he is beginning to explore, he finds a strange plant that spouts a single seed upon his arrival. After a short time, the seed grows into a sprout that waves back and forth. Olimar aproches the sprout and picks it, only to find not a plant but a living creature! The creature, bearing a resemblance to a minature carrot on his planet called a Pikpik, simply stands there looking as Olimar, as if waiting for his orders. He decides he will call this strange species a Pikmin, and must enlist the help of more Pikmin to help him recover his missing ship parts.\n",
       "The game, while challenging but rewarding, is great fun to play, and with time, the Pikmin grow to be not your slaves working for you, but your friends trying to help you, and every time you lose one, its not just another Pikmin gone, its a comrade you have lost in battle.\n",

One collides with your ship. It enter's another planet's atmosphere, where it breaks into 30 pieces which scatter throughout the planet. After you regain consciousness, you find a machine called an Onion. It shoots out a lone seed. It blooms quickly, and you pick it. It is...an animal. One cute enough to make Hello Kitty throw up.\n",

The water looks real enough to drink it, the dirt under your feet kicks up when you walk, and the grass looks like you could mow it from your controller. I've probably run on too long now, so I give Pikmin a 5/5 for graphics.\n",
       "As for the sound, I must say it's just as good. The Pikmin make the cutest little noises. Their feet pitter-patter as they walk, as yours clump along. The enemy creatures scream in agony as you beat them up with your Pikmin. Your rocket makes a roaring noise as it takes off. If that isn't enough, then the best sound thing in the game is when the little Pikmin comes on at the beginning and says \"Nintendo.\" It is the cutest thing you will ever hear. 5/5 for sound.\n",
       "As for its ingenuity, where else can you order around little plant-like creatures on an alien planet for thirty days? This game breaks all genres, creating its own. 5/5 for ingenuity to the max.\n",
       "The game sinks its claws into you and doesn't let go. It's nearly impossible to put down. There are no special features or anything to unlock, but the game has an amazing story line. 5/5 for replay value.\n",

Many people will complain about he music but you'll probably never notice it unless you aren't really playing and just sitting there. The game is a strategy game because you have 3 types of Pikmin and each have their own ability so you have to be smart and plan ahead to know what to do. The game is also timed so it makes it even harder to play. Many will complain about this but that just means that they can't stand up to the test of racing against the clock and that they stink when it comes to strategy.

If there is a gap that you need to cross that is to far apart to get to the other side, Captian Olimar can tell the pikmin to make a bridge. Pikmin are very effeciant and use their enviroment as tools. Just by using twigs, leaves, and vines, they can construct the most sturdy bridge that can be made to walk across. They can make other things too. The more pikmin you have, the faster the job will be done.

Once you have picked them from the ground (thats how you get more pikmin), put them back underground and let them live there until they become stronger. Or you can put them in ships called mushrooms for a certain peiod of time which makes them stroger etc., than they were before. You can put your pikmin in any color mushroom. But if you put them in a mushroom thats their, color, the mushroom will give you lots of pikmin seeds. Pikmin are so loyal in a boss battle taht they will keep fighting until the boss dies even if it takes them to being eaten. If you beat a boss, you can take its dead body, to the mushroom which turn in to more pikmin. There are also pellets with numbers on them which come in three colors, red, blue, and yellow. You can tell you pikmin to carry the pellet to the mushroom to get more pikmin. The number of pikmin you get depened on the nmber n the peller. You have to do your tasks during the day so that the pikmin and you can rest at night so they and you will be fully energized in the morning to start working.\n",

The player is first presented with a Red Pikmin \"Onion\" Breeder from which issues a seed for a red Pikmin \"soldier\".  The player must use the soldier to knock down flowers on which grow Pikmin \"seed\" pellets which he or she can get the soldier to drag back to the onion to be sucked up and then spitted out as new Soldier seedlings.  The soldiers can be led around and thrown at various objects to drag or build or attack those objects to manipulate the spaceman's environment in order to eventually get access to and drag back to the proximity of the ship any of the various 30 parts of it which are strewn all over the place around the planet.  The different colored Pikmin soldiers have different abilities and attributes which may or may not be obvious from the beginning: The red pikmin soldiers are impervious to fire, the yellow can throw glowing exploding rocks at objects to hurt or destroy them and the blue can enter water areas without drowning.  The parts are placed in difficult to access areas which require strategic use of the various pikmin to build, drag or attack various obstacles to clear a path so that they can gain access to and drag them back to the spaceship.  The player has a certain amount of time during each day to drag at least one or two parts back to the spaceship after which he or she must gather all his or her pikmin and shoo them back into their specific onions and then go back to his or her spaceship and take off into the air for the night.  The player has only thirty of these days to retrieve all thirty parts.\n",

But later on when you look around, you find the \"Pikmin\", little alien creatures that are attracted to anything that pulls them out from the ground. The Pikmin are as loyal as dogs and will do whatever you order them to do.

       "Point blank the game is amazing the graphics are Wow!  Nintendo has out done themseleves again.  Pikmin is a one of a kind game.  You have never played anything like this before.  That only should be worth buying the game.  It's different not a rehash of something.  You must know how to use your pikmin in different situations.  That's what makes the game so much fun.  Commanding these little boogers it's awesome.  You realize strength in numbers lol.  This is a must buy game it's so much I can't put it words.  It's a very rewarding experience very different.  Nintendo always changing the game.  Pikmin and Smash bros both very unique and fun.  That's why I love the gamecube because of games like this.  Games on the Xbox you will find on PS2 maybe 2 to 3 months later so no point buying a xbox if you already have a PS2.  Dead or alive 2 is already on the dreamcast and PS2 to believe that Dead or alive 3 won't appear on gamecube and PS2 in the future is lying to yourself.  Halo has been on the PC forever lol, don't know why not it's Xbox's biggest game.  So like I was saying why you get a Gamecueb is because you will never play Pikmin, Mario, Zelda, Smash bros so on and so forth on Xbox and PS2.

From the production of Pikmin, it seems as if he seizes a deep, consoling breath and rips open a bag full of relaxation.  Ah, finally all that dreadful anxiety and flagrant expectations from gaming fans everywhere wash away.  His sheer brilliance veers into a jaunty, animated dream world.  Conclusively, he creates a bizarre game where players are ferried  onto a planet where replicas of giant onions come alive and spawn multicolored, cutesy creatures called Pikmin.  Perhaps Miyamoto's latest game is a minor escape from the daunting task of transcending the GameCube into unreachable stratum?  Whatever the case, Pikmin is not what would we ordinarily expect as a first-class launch title, but it doesn't even fall short to deliver one addictive gem.\n",
       " The player assumes the responsibility of Captain Orima who looks like a freshly baked character from Cartoon Network.  With a big, round nose, a mini space outfit, and a fish bowl for a helmet, it's hard not to think about pummeling the daylights outta' the adorable twerp.  Orima's story is basically a cakewalk.  The captain opts to go on vacation through space, in the duration of his flight, he has a sensible meal of onions when a sudden meteor slams onto his rocket.  Surviving the plunge onto an alien planet, Orima's ship has disintegrated into fragments spread across the land.  He must now retrieve the primary ship parts with the aid of the affable and obedient Pikmin before his spacesuit loses function.\n",
       "\n",
       " Playing in Real Time, Pikmin, at the core, is a strategy game.  At the start, the player sets off with a single, trusty Pikmin and is required to feed a three-legged onion with pellets or butchered insects.  After a certain amount of nourishment, the onions plant seeds that'll eventually sprout as Pikmin.  The essential objective to the game is to manage the carrot-shaped Pikmin and lead them on an expedition throughout the planet to recover Captain Orima's missing ship parts.  There are three fundamental breeds of Pikmin, the red ones red are unscathed by fire, the blue ones wade over water, and the yellow ones cart one another and catapult themselves as organic grenades.  Micromanaging elements are also supplemented for good measure.  Bridges are to be constructed for faster mobilization, walls should be demolished for augmented exploration, and strategy preparation must be done to maintain  the life of the Pikmin.  Frequently, goliath-sized vermin like maggots intrude on the Pikmins` progression.  With a whistle command, Captain Orima can order his army to quit their current task, huddle together and unite for a defensive onset.  Also, the Pikmin may proceed in the offensive, attacking a monster when its simply dozing off.  The maximum number of Pikmin a player can shepherd is a grand total of 100 with absolutely no slowdown whatsoever.  Moreover, the game has a time limit.  Working as a clock, the l6 circles atop the screen move from left to right, and once the furthest one is filled, the day draws to a close.  At the end of each day, the Pikmin must rest overnight and an analysis of the player's personal army is evaluated.  Not particularly lengthy, the addicting game can be whizzed within a jiffy of hours.  Crammed with bonus and high score modes, the game retains a good, extended platter of replayability.  What Miyamoto has done is sculpt the GameCube's first true classic.\n",
       "The GameCube's controller, feeling a bit tweaky at first, succeeds to superbly make a first-rate control scheme.  Captain Orima can be directed individually or accompanied with personal escorts.  The analog stick guides Captain Orima, the A button yanks Pikmin from the soil, the B joins Pikmin together, the X is used to distinguish Pikmin groups into separate colors, and the Y button looms the game information and map.  Additionally, the game's camera can be modified in any direction the player fancies, whether it be overhead, side, or the front.\n",
       "The second Pikmin invades the television screen, the player will irrefutably remark on how the graphics are gorgeously crafted or converged with intoxicating vivacity.  From what I have gathered from the many opinions of other gamers, players will either breath in revulsion or approval.  Technology-wise, the rich world of Pikmin is matchless.  With the control of the camera, the player can zoom in and out, screening through the huge landscapes.  Even the tiniest of details will stimulate the players imagination, like the vast region of mountains and shrubbery.  If not enchanting, the game's surroundings adequately present an overall smooth, graphical touch.  From the lighting, various shadowing, and sheer multitude of animation on the creatures, Pikmin is what I imagine as a tingly trip to la-la land.  Ironically, I felt a bit queasy after a few hours on this colorful madness.  While marveling and vacuuming your life on Pikmin, the players will notice how well the music suits this type of genre.  Indolent, tranquil sounds engulf the environment and is deliberately welcomed.  There are the congenial tunes of a pristine day materializing, and the placid kind which hails approaching slumber.  When an antagonistic intruder stumbles upon the Pikmins' camp, the music is swapped into a more rapid, upbeat tempo.  The musical score  proves to be finely executed.  The eccentric yet delightful sounds from the Pikmin, the battle cries, and other noises add deeply to this already remarkable game.\n",
       "Pikmin's basic gist is to genuinely refresh audiences with  entertaining amusement along with hours of nonstop gameplay.  Throughout the game I found myself beaming at the antics of Captain Orima and how ridiculously hilarious the Pikmin behave.  Initially when a tremendous, next-generation home console is released, a monster of a game convoys along, and although,  Nintendo honcho, Shigeru Miyamoto should have unleashed godhood, a Zelda or Star Fox game, Pikmin does not disappoint and is well worth the ownership for the novel, bold GameCube.</td><td>AAQ75C4BJUQLO</td><td>Sixto Limiac</td><td>{\"Format:\":\" Video Game\"}</td><td>Miyamoto has scuplted the GameCube's first classic</td><td>1006560000</td><td>false</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>B000MXIMKK</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>fits perfectly</td><td>A19UFT0MN9LCAU</td><td>William DeMucci</td><td>{\"Size:\":\" 31W x 30L\",\"Color:\":\" Graphite\"}</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1447632000</td><td>true</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00005Q8LY</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>What is Piknim really?

Piknim is pretty much lemmings but with better graphics, a 3-d playing field and a lot more complex i recomend this game to 8 to 126 8 being the youngest because there is some strategy involved and would be best injoyed if you are old enough to understand it. 126 being the highest because thats the longest anyone human has ever lived. If you've played lemmings you don't need to read the rest of this review if you haven't you still don't have to read the rest of this review but if you really must go ahead. In Lemmings you have a certain number of lemmings they will keep walking if you encounter an obsticle such as a lava pit you must send a couple of your lemmings to build a bridge before the rest of your lemmings catch up and run right off the edge into the lava. Piknim is said to be much like this except piknim has a plot you are a stranded space man you collect your piknim and they help you on your task of finding the missing parts to your ship.

       "When you think about Hockey, you know violence is involved. Players don't where layers of padding for nothing! But NHL does more than that. Not many Hockey games are this aggressive. Players literacy trip others with their sticks when attempting to steal the puck. When you check, you check hard. You will sometimes push, shove with your shoulder, or hold your stick horizontally and smash your opponent. OUCH! There are a bunch of teams. When selecting a team, it will show their stats for Defense, Offense, and Speed, which can be 1-20, the higher the better. On the ice is great. You select a center, a winger, and a man on defense. The Goalie is a selected player. The Goalie can be the CPU or the User, you select. Not to mention after each game, you get awarded a certain # of credits. You receive 100/150/200 for playing in Rookie/Pro/All-star mode and get 30/60/90 points for answering an easy/medium/hard question after the game is done. You can then go to the sports shop and purchase New jerseys, (100c) New teams, (500-1000c) New Arenas, (500c) or New heads for create-a-player. (300-700c) With your choice on Franchise/Exhibition/Championship/Create-a-player (or team)/Skills, NHL 20-02 gets a 10/10 for gameplay.\n",
       "It finally happened! I have waited so long for someone to say \"Hey, here's an Idea, lets have the audience in 3D!\" In every sports game I've seen, the Audience are cardboard figures, with choppy movement of them throwing a hand in the air and then to their side. Thank you Blackbox! The Audience reacts with great effects. The on-ice is also great. Each team player has amazing details. When getting different levels, the puck is different! On a moon rink, the puck is a moon-rock. On the Disco rink, the puck is mirror-ball. It's hilarious! When you look at the Goalie, is padding is spectacular. With Phenomenal 3D enriched environment, NHL Hitz gets a 10/10 for graphics. And don't forget the jerseys, all of them have the logo on them.\n",
       "There's not much to say about the sound. You just hear the clashing of sticks, the stick breaking the sound barrier, and the crowd cheering (or booing!) at players.  The announcers aren't that spectacular. Unlike Madden, where the commentators explain about what's going on, what's happened last season, what they should do, and reaction to plays, NHL Hitz has people who say \"[Insert name of player here] just took a shot!\" \"Blocked by [Insert name of player here]\" \"Puck stolen from [Insert name of player here] by [Insert name of player here].\" It's rather boring, so I think I can safely sleep at night without felling too bad by giving the sound an 8.5/10\n",
       "Now, when I say speed, I don't mean how fast Wayne Gretzky and glide down the rink, I mean loading time. Again, contrary to madden, the loading time is exceptionally fast. The only tiny problem is it takes about a quarter of a second for the players faces to load when selecting your team. What's even better, is you can set the speed of the game! If things are too fast for you on the ice, just crank down the speed a notch. Call me crazy, but Speed gets an 11/10.\n",
       "Controlling the players is no fun. It's watching the expression on your friends face and you juke his opponent, fake shot and pass it, move the puck to the side of you as he attempts to stick slap you, watch your CPU character bash him out of the rink, breaking the glass, and doing a slap-shot right into the net as you win the game. Now, do you know how hard that scenario would be? You don't, BECAUSE IT'S NOT! Look, to do this, I would press Y, X, Hold B and press A, the CPU would \"press\" y, and then I would Hold B to my liking to choose how hard I should hit it. The longer you hold, the harder you hit. With simple controls like A to pass, B to shoot, X to guard puck, and Y to spin, and on defense, a to switch players, B to stick-slap and attempt to steal, Y to do a check, and X to do... well I don't think it does anything. Then by pressing R or L to go into the Patented \"Turbo\" mode, the controlling makes the grade with a 10/10.\n",
       "Replay ... well DUH! I'm not going to buy a Hockey game and play it once. All sport games have to get a 10/10 for replay or they just aren't worth buying. So, obviously, NHL Hitz 20-02 gets a 10/10 for Replay.\n",

The graphics are excellent for a hockey game(only NHL2K for Dreamcast is better). Game play is intense! Fast, furious and nonstop! Although you can control the speed of the game in the options screen and slow things down, but why would you? Control of the skaters is a bit awkward and difficult at first, but is easily overcome with practice. Smooth player movements and precise commentary add to the game. Options, and many of them!! Choose your favorite NHL team, one of Midway's \"special teams\" or create your own. Choose your teams colors, jerseys, logos, your teams stadium and yes, even nicknames that the announcers will say during the game! And plenty more options to choose from! Trade players, fights, and even trivia questions that can earn you points to increase your players skills. There is even a \"Skills\" game that helps you increase your hockey skills to be a better opponent for the computer! This game has more features and options than I have mentioned here. Bottom line is this, NHL Hitz is the best 3 on 3 hockey game for any game system! This is a MUST for any video game player, even if are not a hockey fan!

       "  I was a bit skeptical about the game at first. I mean, I've got the 'awsome, eyecandy' of a hockey game called NHL 2002 by EA Sports for my computer, so I didn't really know if I was gonna like this. I tried it out a little...and...GUESS WHAT!?!?!? I fell in love with this game. It's NHL hockey as it was MEAN'T to be; Big Hits (and I mean BIG HITS!!!), dramatic goals, HUGE FIGHTS, and CHEAT CODES! ;)\n",
       "  This game is the NHL version of the Midway classic known as NFL Blitz (which also had sequels each year for roster updates, graphics improvment, and more features). You start the game off with 3 gameplay modes: Exhibition, Season, and Franchise. And there is also some extras like: the Hockey Store, and Create-a-Team feature.\n",
       "  Exhibition is the basic mode of the game if you want some classic fun (and you can also play this mode multiplayer with up to 3 other people). You pick your team from a colection of ALL the NHL teams in the league (but I am sorry to say: NO international teams). You can also buy more teams at the hockey shop. Once your done picking your teams, you pick three players (from a list of six) for your team to have as your line for the first period. After that you will procede to the section where you have 5 seconds to type in cheat codes (like bigger hits, huge heads, tennis ball puck, ect.) Once your done picking your hockey dudes and doing cheats, you will go to a cool, and somethimes comical, Pre-game show.\n",
       "  There are NO penalties in this game; the only way for your player to be kicked out of a game is...LOSE a FIGHT!!! If you lose a fight, the player that lost the fight is out of the game. The fights are awsome: VERY DRAMATIC.\n",
       "  In season mode, it is basically that same as most hockey games: you go through the season and try to win the STANLEY CUP.\n",
       "  In franchise mode, you try to make your created team better (as you get more points to improve created players with each franchise win). You try to win the MIDWAY CUP.\n",
       "  At the Hockey Shop, you can buy various nostalgic jerseys, new arenas, new teams, and special heads for created players. You earn points for playing exhibition games and season games, and you use these points for the hockey shop.\n",
       "  It create-a-team mode, you can create a team by customizing your jersey logo, jersey color scheme, and team name. You can create six players and one goalie for your team. You start out with a limited amount of points to make your player attributes. BUT that is what franchise mode is for: yo earn points to make your players better. You can chose different faces for your player. You also custumize your player's body size and stuff: the players can look any way you want.\n",
       "  There are also alot of options to customize like game speed and music style. The Graphics are a bit on the weak side (as they could have been better). The sound is awesome. The commentator is pretty funny. Also, the controls are pretty easy to learn.\n",
       "  If you are looking for adrenaline pumping hockey action, NHL Hitz is for you. It's no were near a hockey sim, but that's WHY it's fun. If you want a hockey sim, I suggest buying NHL 2002 by EA Sports for PS2, X-Box, or computer...or you can wait till fall of 2002 till the SEGA NHL 2K3 comes out for the GCN. But if you want a FUN, arcade style hockey game, this game is for you.\n",

It's not. This is a first-rate game at a bargain price. It is a WW II mission-based game in which you control a squad of men into Germany. You can switch at ANY time from first to third person. You can also switch bodies with any of your men at any time, which is really cool. You can command your men to hold position, attack, or follow in a variety of formations. You can commandeer vehicles. The sniper rifle has always been my favorite gun in any game that offers them, and I was delighted to see one here, and it works fine. You must sneak and strategize to survive. When starting the game you pick your squad from 12 available men with different skills. Then you outfit them however you like. This is a nice feature and is more involving than other shooters, but it is very easy to do. There are rain effects, and the grass even blows in the wind. The graphics are great, and I was amazed to find that the game ran smoothly (640 x 480) on my ageing PII 450 with an NVidia TNT 1 video card. I'm running 256 MB ram and 16 MB video ram. I'm running it with high detail. I imagine if your video card is 32 MB, you could crank the resolution higher and still get good framerates. This game even comes with a small manual, which contains most everything you'll need to know to play the game. Others have mentioned a few graphical glitches, but I have seen none of those on my system, and I suspect video card driver problems with those who have had those problems. Bottom line: This would be a great game even if it was full-priced. This is the best money I've spent all year, and I can only hope this low pricing is the start of a trend.</td><td>A2EOCDPEG6K1WQ</td><td>Mark Lahren</td><td>null</td><td>Best bang for the buck!</td><td>1005868800</td><td>false</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>B000MXIN22</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>Perfect fit, the expandable waist is great, just took it out of the package and wore it, no iron.

A prone (laying down) position would make this game a whole lot better.  Also, I have found a snag with the graphics.  A few of the weapons and all of the helmets worn by the soldiers appear in solid white.  It might be my system, but it is fairly new, so I do not think it is the problem.

There is  a d-day mission that kicks [heiny], and an Africa and Remagan mission, the weapon selection is very small but the weapons available get the job done, the game is very difficult; i spent all day from morning until 8 at night playing it and i beat it, and went back and played a few other missions for fun.  The vehichles add greatly to the gameplay and make it much more fun.  Although my major gripes are that there should be more Americans fighting along side you and around you during the more large scale missions, and lastly the Germans simply won't go down, i fired an Mp40 into the chest of a nazi at less than three feet away and lost a whole clip before he rolled over and died finnaly.  Overall this game is really good if your sick of the all first person no strategy of medal of honor which is still great.  Or if you want a solid time consuming weekend killer.

The modes of play are the exact same, and since the GCN verison is the last to come out, it will have the most recent team changes.

So, it was easy to compare the three versions of the game on three different platforms.  The first thing that jumped out was the attention to detail.  The players, the stadiums, the lighting effects, the sounds and the animations were all incredible.  Player movements were very smooth in all phases of the game.  There was so much detail in the player models that you could identify players by the way they moved.  The video game version of Chris Carter actually moved like the real one.  In terms of control and gameplay, I walked right up to the Gamecube version of the game and started completing passes almost immediately.

       "What makes Madden unbeleivble is it's awesome \"Instant Replay\" option. You can see the entire field, with the abilility to move, turn and zoom freely. You can choose EAsy mode (Get it, EAsy for EA sports. Heh, heh) and Normal. Also you may select Madden Cards (Which is cool feature) or training. During the game you can get points for completing certain goals (i.e, making a 30 yard pass, intercepting, sacking the QB making 3 tackels with one player, a 30 yard field goal, etc) Not to forget the ability to turn penalties on, or decrease there size. With a create-a-team option or God-like players (On the Ecko team) Gameplay gets 10/10.\n",
       "The graphics don't get much better. With details on every player, coach and referee, it's amazing. Instant Replay's aren't grainy or choppy, they look perfect. There is absolutly nothing wrong with the graphics. It gets a perfect 10/10.\n",
       "Because it's EA you know that the commentary will be great. John Madden cracks me up with his little sayings he quotes. Not to mention you can hear the announcer say funny phrases. Such as, once, I cleary heard him say \"Would the owner of a blue jeep cherokee, liscene 767-EXE please report to the parking lot? You're vehicle is on fire.\" What's wrong with it? Well, either i'm havinh Deja Vu, or the people say the same things maybe 3 times per game. After a while it gets boring because the don't say new things. With a small subtraction because of repetition, the sound receives a 8/10.\n",
       "Speed? Well, let me just say I wasn't happy. Unlike other Gamecube games, which load within 5 or 10 seconds, Madden takes 30-35 seconds. It's worth it in the end though! Unfortunatly, I have to nail the speed by giving it a harsh 7/10.\n",
       "Controls are amazing. It just makes perfect sense! When the ball is snapped, you will see an A,B,X,R or L over certain players heads. (During Normal mode you must press \"A\" first) Just press the corresponding button and the QB will pass. X is spin. Y is jump. C-stick in stiff arms. B is dive. It just makes perfect sense. A 10/10 is definitly fair for this element.\n",
       "Replay ... well DUH! I'm not going to buy a Football game and play it once. I think all sports game need to have a 10/10 for replay or they just aren't worth buying. So, of course, Madden 2002 gets a 10/10\n",

       "The main difference that I can see between 2001 and 2002 is being able to use the Houston Texans. It's a pretty cool concept in the franchise mode because you get to build from the ground up and draft every single position. It's definitely worth the time it takes when you start winning games. Make up a coach, make up some players, choose a playbook and see how good of a GM you are as well.\n",
       "My only real problem with Madden 2002 is the repetitive commentary. It really becomes monotonous after the first few games, and I ended up turning the sound down and playing a CD instead. Madden even uses a lot of sayings from the old versions - most of which are not insightful in the least. They really could've used a bigger soundtrack and I hope they do in the future.\n",
       "All in all, if you are a football fan you'll love this game. It looks and plays great and Madden's voice over is no reason to pass this game up. And for those of you who are wary about the intricate playbooks - there's a tutorial mode that explains the plays as you run them.

       "But after you're done hearing that \"the owner of the red sports car has left your lights on,\" you want great gameplay, and Madden delivers. You can just play single games, or you can do an entire season. But if you want more, you can even run a franchise through 30 seasons drafting players and building superstars over the years.\n",
       "Another dimension of the game is the Madden Cards.

       "Perhaps its simplicity is the key. That, and the delightful narrator who sounds suspiciously like Sean Connery. The premise is that you get an area map of the kingdom with all kinds of quests or challenges that you must complete -- from wiping out the monsters, to reclaiming your crown, seeking the holy chalice, to rescuing your son who's been kidnapped by evil elves. The beginner levels will get you into the game and understand how it works; it's fairly intuitive and a fast learn. The advanced levels offer some challenge; some more difficult than others, and will test your ability to logically figure out solutions. I've yet to get to the expert levels.\n",
       "While there is fighting in this game, once you build your \"army\" (consisting of necromancers, wizards, warriors, rogues and explorers), they automatically fight any enemy that enters your domain. They will also go off and fight enemies at greater distances. You can set reward flags up to have your army target and destroy one enemy camp over another.\n",
       "Another great aspect of this game is that you get to build up your little kingdom. You place your wizards' guild, your rogues' guild, your warriors' guild and then magically houses begin to sprout up and pad out your town. You also upgrade your levels with gold, research new attack methods with a library or through the guilds, and create marketplaces and blacksmith's shops. Upgrading will get you new types of buildings (like temples) and you can watch your castle grow along with your kingdom.\n",

       "The funny thing about this game is the fact that even after 10 or so years, there has yet to be an RTS that is so refreshing in gameplay. I'm not saying this is the best RTS, I'm just saying it is a refreshing change from what we gamers have gotten use to. Just in case you didn't know, in Majesty you have no direct control over your units. You can build buildings, do research to upgrade items or abilities, and even cast mighty spells throughout the map, but the one thing you can't do is control those who follow you. You can entice your units with gold, but in the end they do what they want to do.\n",

       "This type of gameplay gives the game a special charm. Each hero, or heroine, is born into the world with their own randomly generated name, which allows you to distinguish the brave ones from the cowards, and the foolish ones from the wise. They also seem to have a personality of there own (I could just be imagining it though). For example, I'll have a level 9 knight who always goes head on into danger, while I'll have a level 12 knight who always plays it smart, and flees if he thinks he is in over his head. This type of gameplay allows you to get attached to certain heroes. You'll get so attached that you'll find yourself spending money to cast your healing spell on that level 21 paladin who you've watched get out of tougher scrapes (than going toe toe with two vampires and werewolf), but who just ran out of healing potions and is about to bite the dust.\n",

       "The basic concept behind Majesty is that the player is a king or queen in a medieval fantasy country called Ardania. This kingdom is inhabited by all the adventurers and monsters one would expect from such a setting. As monarch, the player cannot directly intervene in most cases; compare this to, say, Warcraft, where everyone is under the player's direct control. The monarch in Majesty can place building plans (which peasants will automatically redirect towards constructing), cast spells (if the appropriate facilities are constructed), hire heroes, purchase upgrades to buildings and place reward flags. This is the extent of your power; you cannot directly tell a warrior to go destroy a troll attacking your town, but you can place a bounty on its head so that heroes will want to go get it. This is the key difference from Warcraft; the game is half about strategy and half about convincing your kingdom's heroes that they should help you.\n",
       "\n",
       "The main focus of the game is the heroes, of course; by building various types of guilds, you can recruit a certain number of heroes (usually four per guild). These guilds include warrior's guilds, ranger's guilds, wizard's guilds, and temples of various gods and goddesses. Different heroes have different temperaments and abilities. Rogues are greedy and will pilfer from enemy buildings and lairs more than they'll destroy them, but are easily influenced by reward flags. Rangers spend most of their time exploring, and act as the eyes and ears of the sovereign. Wizards can cast powerful spells, but are fragile. Gnomes aren't good fighters, but are cheap and will help the peasants build things around the settlement. Certain groups (priests and non-human races, primarily) do not like certain other groups. Elves, gnomes, and dwarves all dislike each other, so you can only have one group in your kingdom at a time. Temples have rivalries and friends - the temples of Law and Good like each other, but dislike Chaos and Evil (and vice versa). The same goes for the temples of the Sun and Moon Gods - you can only have one of either at a time.\n",
       "\n",
       "Other buildings are usually meant to either defend your settlement (namely, the guardhouses that are staffed by city watchmen and can shoot arrows at enemies) or support your hero population. Of the second group, there are blacksmiths (that upgrade weapons), marketplaces (that sell various magic items), tournament grounds (for training), and various types of inns and relaxation areas. Heroes earn money through adventuring or by collecting the bounties you set for them; they spend this money on upgrades for themselves. The hero AI is pretty smart, and heroes most of the time will know when to purchase new things, when to use their special abilities, when to use healing potions, and when to flee from battle. Heroes also level up through combat, so it's to your benefit to try to keep your heroes alive (so that they can deal with the stronger threats plaguing your kingdom). Enemies also come in various sizes, as well, from the low-level giant rats to various types of goblins and ratmen to stronger foes like medusas and hydras. Their level belies their rarity; rats will come through sewer vents to attack your town and cannot be stopped (the sewer is a necessary part for a growing city) but medusas will only come into your kingdom once in a rare while.\n",
       "\n",
       "The graphics in this game - done in a 2D cartoonish style without being weirdly proportioned - still look pretty good today. Unlike a lot of old games, it looks like \"well-drawn 2d\" instead of \"blocky 3d\", which works to its advantage. Heroes and monsters all have portraits (one per class or monster type, not individual portraits) that are well illustrated. The music is good, though the same music gets used a lot. The voice acting is extensive, with a different voice for every type of hero, and a quip for every situation (the things they say are helpful with running the kingdom, to serve as a quick indication of what they're doing). There is also a royal advisor who assists you during play who has a fairly humorous Sean Connery accent.\n",

In other words, you build your kingdom, and it looks after itself (if you've done your job properly). You cannot direct your population to attack foes, and you cannot micromanage the behaviour of your units.

       "This twist could have made for some very innovative gameplay, but there are enough flaws to prevent it from being truly successful.  First, control is difficult.  There are only two levels of map zoom and no way to rotate the view.  So, when you want to place a reward flag on a troll hiding behind a building to get your warriors to come attack him, you're pretty much out of luck.\n",
       "Secondly, there is little variety in the rewards.  You can either set an attack flag on a structure or enemy character, or you can set an explore flag on unexplored territory.  That's it.  You cannot, for instance, offer a reward to get your guys to hang out close to your town to defend it.  This can be balanced out once you begin to understand the natural behaviour of the different sorts of heroes.\n",
       "There are no relationships between quests other than a couple of them having prerequisites.  So, essentially, there is no campaign, just a bunch of scenarios.  The maps are semi-randomly generated.  This might add some replayability, but it can also result in some very lame quests where the objective pops up right outside your starting point.\n",

       "\"Majesty,\" though, solves that problem. Sure, it's a sim, a medieval fantasy version of \"SimCity\" by way of \"Dungeons & Dragons.\" In addition to creating rogues guilds, dwarven settlements, blacksmithies and the like, \"Majesty\" is based around \"epic quest\" scenarios wherein you're challenged to defeat some evil facing the land, send your heroes on a quest for some fabled artifact, rescue a hostage taken by villains and so on.\n",
       "Just as in \"SimCity,\" you don't control your wizards, warriors, rogues, elves, dwarves, gnomes, thieves and so on. Instead, you have to do what any good monarch does in a fantasy game: Put prices on monsters' heads and offer rewards for heroes willing to explore unknown (and almost certainly hostile) territory.\n",
       "\"Majesty\" is a hoot, and a massive timesink: You'll lose whole nights and weekends to it without realizing it, and love every minute of trying to squeeze a bit more service out of heroes who'd rather laze about the inn than go study new spells or visit an elven hut-of-ill-repute than go fight the troll heading for the kingdom's market.\n",
       "The epic quests included with on the original disk are fun, and an additional one is available from on the official Web site. But while there's a large jump from the beginner to advanced quests and then another more moderate jump from advanced to expert quests, they ultimately don't prove too challenging overall. Expect to finish most of the quests with a week or two of nightly play (less if you've got more time to devote to the game).\n",
       "The good news is that this edition includes \"The Northern Expansion,\" and suddenly, the game jumps up a fair bit in difficulty -- although not beyond that which most players can handle, if they've played through the original missions -- and the difficulty scales up nicely from there. The expansion otherwise adds new buildings and monsters, but while these are nice, the real value of it is in having more (and more difficult) adventures.\n",

       "In Majesty, you don't waste your time mining and directing minions to go hither and yon. You build your castle, your kingdom's amenities and, as you can afford themn, hero guilds. Each hero guild can support a certain number of heroes (usually 4), although you'll usually have to buy heroes.\n",
       "But fret not, because each hero will pay you back many times over by visiting your marketplaces, blacksmiths, inns, and son on. In addition, each guild generates a bit of money on its own, and some provide extra services which can generate revenue.\n",
       "Your tax collectors will walk from building to building collecting gold, ultimately returning it to your castle or nearby guard houses, while your heroes do whatever they do best. (Rangers explore, rogues steal, and so on.)\n",
       "The more you build, the more support buildings (peasant huts) will pop up, themselves generating some revenue. Other side effects of urban life (like sewer drains) will appear, too.\n",
       "The lands are always plagued with some menace or other, however, and its your job as king to make the world safe for--well, your taxpayers. Majesty, however, unlike most other RTSes, gives you no means to directly manipulate your subjects.\n",
       "If you want a monster dead, then, you must place a bounty on it. If you're trying to destroy the evil crypt generating vampires, you must place a bounty on that. If you want to explore a dark area of the map, you can place an explore flag and try to draw heroes there--for a price.\n",
       "All-in-all, this formula works, though it's not yet perfected. The balance between building facilities (like the marketplace) and building the guilds/generating heroes that you need to protect your kingdom is very well done. The heroes autonomy is good: Sometimes the destruction of a certain target will result in a greater evil being released, so you'll want to delay that--but your Paladins will have other ideas. On the other hand, your heroes can be so aggressive on their own that they win the game for you while you're not even aware of it.\n",
       "If you've built a solid infrastructure for your city, you know you've won. The difference between a beginner's game and an expert's game becomes whether you can survive the opening minutes, and occasionally how well you prepare for the trigger event (the accomplishing of one goal that results in a rush of monsters).\n",

       "Majesty Gold includes the Northern Expansion, an add-on of modest proportions with some tweaks to the rules to make the game harder. The add-on parts, with the tougher, winter-oriented monsters, are quite cool. The tweaks to the game rules, on the other hand, show the game's relative newness. They do make the game harder, but only by way of making it somewhat more frantic in those opening minutes: Even with the tweaks, it's an easy game.\n",
       "But that's to be expected: The designers can't directly borrow from Starcraft (and clones) to get ideas. They have a new framework to figure out. Majesty 2 is not a shoo-in at this point, but let's hope the developers get a chance to do it. This is an interesting new direction that should be explored.\n",

Veteran strategy gamers know that Koei and RTK are practically joined at the hip. So it's no surprise that after launching Kessen last year with an ancient Japanese scenario, Koei's returned to familiar territory for Kessen II. This historical PlayStation 2 strategy game's more show than go...but what a show! Kessen II's visuals are primarily a spectacular display of computer-generated cinematics. You witness titanic clashes between armies, awesome elemental magic attacks, stunning ninja fights, and ingenious Asian instruments of war. It's like watching the trailer for some awesome anime DVD! However, things trail off dramatically once you get into the gameplay. The workmanlike controls don't ask you to do much, but they enable you to adequately oversee 30 campaigns. You can easily select battle units and painstakingly move them into position with the overhead view contour map. The pacing here is very slow as you select and then move multiple units. It also takes several minutes for units to reach their positions, but at least you can watch some great movies as they charge forward.\n",

You spend a lot of time just watching, but you also have the option of affecting the outcome by quickly zooming in on a particular battle to control an individual commander. A few simple button presses enable you to bust magic attacks and you can jam buttons to fight with weapons, but moving around with the joysticks is slow and imprecise. Kessen II gets pop from nicely synched music and dramatic dialogue that you must hear to advance through the game. However, since it's translated from Japanese and is so movie-like in its presentation, it occasionally suffers from stereotypically wacky dubbing. Some dialogue doesn't match lip movement and a few voices don't fit the look and feel of the characters-you hear ancient Chinese warriors talk with the hint of irritating Valley girl accent or a little stoner dude drawl.

I have met many a person who \"talks with their hands\" and this is way, WAY beyond that. Now the heart and soul of the game is mass combat. Too bad it never really seems like you are doing anything. You will win when you think you are losing and lose when things seem to be going well. You then finally win a large engagement only to have the cutscenes inform you that your armies broke in a most cowardly manner and you really lost the fight. I mean c'mon!!! Yeah that really makes me care about a plot when it is arbitrarily decided for the games miserable excuse for a plot. Your girlfriend and bride to be has been kidnapped. WOW! I have never seen that one before. This is SO not romance of the three kingdoms and spending money on this game will infuriate you. It is foolish and juvenile in the worst ways with voice acting and plot so bad you are embarrased when someone sees you playing it and can actually hear what is being said...

Answer: none.  Starcraft 64, eat your heart out.\n",
       "Firstly, the game utalizes simple commands to execute larger-scale movements.  When forces are in thousands of soldiers in size, in real life you'd probably lose immediate and fast control over them all pretty quickly too....this game as such seemed to be more realistic in that fashion.  There're really only three unrealistic aspects to the gameplay: 1) you can command a force that's miles away from you instantly; 2) there is lots of sorcery; and 3) how do you get so many legions of men to fight the corrupt?\n",
       "Secondly, the graphics are amazing.  Full of color and activity.  Seeing 500 troops with only partial slowdown is very nice, and the fact that you can control an officer to get involved in the combat to see it up close.  When you're not in control, an automatic camera changes perspective of your troops, be they running or battling (something the original Kessen lacked graphically, putting me to sleep, personally).  The game is also full of great special effects (and I'm not even brushing upon the SFX in the FMV, or the FMV itself yet!).  When dueling, sparks fly, and energy is shot out from these heroes' combatting, and the spell effects are simply huge in scale, and destruction.\n",
       "Thirdly, the music is worthy of purchasing the soundtrack even if you haven't played the game.  It's fully symphonized, somewhat catchy, easy to listen to, and full of emotion.  True, the voice work here and there cries out: \"I'm a good actor, but I don't know what I'm doing!\"  However, they still tell the story well enough for the most part...good during the important moments at least.\n",
       "Finally, cinematically and emotionally, this game is incredible.  FMV drives the story like one would not believe.  Kessen II truly has about 3x as much FMV as Final Fantasy X, and for a game only about 8 hours long, that's far beyond amazing!!  I sometimes still watch the FMV at the begining because it's so amazingly full of emotion, and beautifully photographed; being a film major, the lighting, scenery, item placement and art direction is important to me greatly, and I am fully satisfied here!  When people tell me that games like this and Final Fantasy X and Xenosaga are too cinematic, frankly I get very aggrivated...instead I ask: \"why can't all movies be as deep and engaging as these games?\"  GAMES!!  Why is Hollywood, save a few nice epics, falling behind what was once Pong?!\n",

I have read some reviewers claim that in between battles you are given many choices on how to guide you army.  Unfortunately, I do have to disagree with this claim.\n",

       "However, the gameplay of this game is not based on what you do in between battles.  This game is completely based upon the battles themselves.  The battles are amazing and will force many players to develop new ideas for strategy battles.  It is difficult to explain in words what sets these battles apart from other games but I must proclaim that you have not played a battle sequence as amazing as this game.  You are given control of about 4-7 generals each commanding their 5000-10000 soldiers.  You can choose to let you officers to do their own thing, or you can give each of them direct orders.  Also, once an officer initiates combat with another officer you can take control of the actual hand-to-hand fight.  Your officer will have either special strength attacks or some magic ablility and you can use them to slaughter you enemy.\n",

       "1) You can no longer directly determine what to do with the units in terms of placing them and the grand strategy involved.  All the unit commands have to be issued after you adopt one of the three strategies you can choose from in the beginning of any map.  The problem with this is that sometimes it completely determins how you can play, for example the battle between Cao Cao and Sun Quan -- where you place the mines determine where you units go.  Also, the maps are small in comparison with the old game, and there's just not much room to move a lot of times, limiting your strategic choices. Battles often end up as a crash of two lines and not much strategic nicety involved.\n",
       "2.  It seems like the game is even more heavily geared towards the special moves that you can use -- if timed properly, the fight between the two units is over in minutse.  If your guy has no special maneuveur left, there's no way to try to get one (no more zeal rating) and you just have to wait it out, which could be painful.\n",
       "3. There's nothing that really goes on in addition to what happens in the battle.  Whereas in the previous game you can pick who to use, who to try to convince to come to your side, etc, in this game all there is is to choose one of three options that upgrade one thing over another.  It's very simplistic -- I think too simplistic -- to be fun.\n",

However despite a fantastically labored frame rate, finely portrayed graphics, and an amazing initial dramatic draw, Kessen 2 reduces the gamer's options and responsibilities in the game itself.

       "What's wrong with this game? For starters, you have to insert the CD every time you want to play. The game doesn't copy to your hard drive. That's a lot a unnecessary trouble to go to just for a few minutes' diversion. Very inconvenient. Next, there is this bogus storyline attached to the game. Folks, this is TETRIS, it doesn't need a back story, it just IS. And don't make the mistake of starting in \"Arcade\" mode where every shape is that identical four-space bar. What a total waste of time that is! How many times do you have to bore yourself with that one level until you can move on? I didn't bother to find out. When you find your way to the game you know and love as \"classic\" Tetris, it doesn't even keep a running tally for you of how many lines you've cleared until the game is over, and to me that's always been the whole point of the game. I do admit I like the sexy voice every time you clear a line or four telling you what you've done. But there is too much folderol here, too much unnecessary production and bother.
